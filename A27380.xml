            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

its hopeful productions to be foſtered up and cheriſhed by the care of providence, or the charitable pitie of ſome accidental Paſſenger.</p>
            <p>This Character I have of the worthy and learned Author of theſe <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> from acquaintance, and his own ſober Pen; and the ſame I dare avow of my Friend the <hi>Replyer.</hi> And that as the former intended only his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſatisfaction; ſo the later had no further end in his eye, than to ſatisfie ſo candid an Enquirers particular ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or perhaps a grateful reſpect to that incomparable and much envied Maſter of his, the great <hi>Explainer</hi> of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> to the defence of whoſe Doctrine he owes the imployment of that ſtrength the ſame Doctrine had given him. Yet, why may I not add, too, as a likely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his pains, at any fair hint of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, his high zeal for the ſubject it ſelf, <hi>Tradition;</hi> ſo onelily important, ſo radically influential towards ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in faith, That <hi>Ruſhworths Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues,</hi> and <hi>the Apology</hi> for them

            <p>Now though I am bound by my Reaſon to hold the victory on my friends ſide, and to expect the Readers ſhould judge the ſame; yet I profeſs ingenuouſly I printed not this out of a conceit that the weak carriage of the Objector gave any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or incouragement; but rather impute much to his excellent wit, that uſing a cleer and unblundering expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (a thing rare in ſuch Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) could manage ſo well ſo infirm a cauſe; and that having weighed Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with his, I judged this far the more nervous, manly, and worthy my Friends thoughts, then the former; not only becauſe that affects too much wordiſhneſs, and confuſedneſs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ the death of its Author might make it, with ſom ſhew of reaſon, objected, that it was ignoble to ſeek to triumph over the aſhes of one adverſary, and decline others, yet alive of equal or greater force, entring the liſts upon the ſame quarrel.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">¶. 4. You put the contradictory to your Adverſary, which you aſſume to prove fairly, meaning by <hi>Salvation,</hi> the the ſalvation of mankinde, as I preſume you do: But your reaſons ſeem to come ſhort of your intent: For ſuppoſe all true which you urge to the tenth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph, namely, that the alterations mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be poſſible (whereof you deny not but that many have hapned, yet) have not all of them actually befallen Scripture. Suppoſe I ſay this to be true, what a Chaos is there betwixt that Premiſe, and your Concluſion, That Faith may with ſufficient certainty be proved out of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? For though all have not hapned, yet ſince ſome have, and you are uncertain preciſely where, 'tis manifeſt you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be certain, but that they have hapned in whatſoever Text you ſhall pitch upon to prove any thing by, and conſequently you can never be abſolutely certain of any;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52610:8"/>
again, ſince Demoſtration implyes a <hi>muſt be</hi> of the Concluſion, and <hi>muſt be</hi> evidently excludes <hi>may be</hi> of the oppoſite, 'tis plain, that to deſtroy Demonſtration, that is, in this caſe, ſufficient certainty, it ſuffices to prove the oppoſite may be; ſo that though it be granted, theſe alterations have not all hapned, yet while there appears a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility they may have done ſo, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears an impoſſibility of ever coming to a rigorous certainty by Scripture. But to take particular notice of every Paragraph.</p>
                  <p n="5">¶ 5. 1. <hi>It ſeems to me more improbable that nothing of Scripture (as you ſay) ſhould be contrary to your Faith (ſuppoſing it the true) notwithſtanding thoſe innumerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of Scripture, then that all thoſe alterations of Scripture (proved Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally only poſsible) ſhould actually have befell the Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">¶. 5. 'Tis very ſtrange it ſhould appear improbable to you, but that Scripture and our Faith muſt needs contradict one another, ſuppoſing the one to be Scripture, and the other true, as you do: Muſt truths needs be oppoſed to themſelves, which have hitherto been eſteem'd oppoſite only to falſhood? If you mean by Scripture,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52610:9"/>
the alterations of Scripture, as the ſequel makes me imagin, how much wrong do you do the Word? for if Scripture be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or changed from what it was, then 'tis not what it was, that is, 'tis not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But of theſe Alterations 'tis not our Tenet, that none of them have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Faith (the alterations made by the Tranſlations of the firſt Founders of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy having been judged ſo contrary to it, that it occaſioned the prohibition to read the Scriptures in Vulgar Tongues) But only that there is nothing in the Vulgar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, according to that ſence, in which the Church underſtands it, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her faith. And if you will allow the Church but to know the Faith ſhe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to teach, and know what ſhe means by what ſhe reads, and what a contradiction is, [three Requeſts which cannot well be refuſed her] you muſt make her very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, if you deny her power to diſcern whether there be between what ſhe reads, and what ſhe teaches, any contradiction or not.</p>

they are innumerable even to every line and word</hi> (as Mr. White) <hi>and how is it poſſible, that all thoſe deviations from true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould in nothing contradict truths, for you ſay there is nothing in Scripture contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your faith, therefore ſurely you cannot think there are ſo many corruptions; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he himſelf hath (leſt he ſhould prove more then he was willing) many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies had the ſame faults; I adde, that the Chriſtians, in the Primitive times, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful of the Bible, eſpecially when Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were made for publike uſe to be in the Church, there was the greateſt diligence poſsible taken to have the oldeſt and beſt, which they might have better ground to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern then we can, who lived nigher the firſt Age; beſides the ancienteſt Copies, the beſt being kept by publike care were more ſecure, and could, yea did remain many hundred years (as ſome there are to this very day) by which the Copies that are afterward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out, may eſcape many corruptions of others before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">¶. 6. You ſee then how the firſt part of this Paraph is anſwered; for we do not ſay that our Faith has never been contradicted by theſe deviations, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                  <p>And for the ſecond part of it, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the care of the Primitive Chriſtians, as I will not deny what you ſay, to have ſome probability, ſo neither can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that probability will not ſerve the turn; and that their care, how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, exempted them not from being men, and ſubject to the caſualties of humane actions.

For it being known, the Church was under perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution 300 years; the experience I have how hard it is in this depreſſion, we our ſelves live in, to preſerve monuments in a condition fit to undergo a ſevere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical examination, much leſs ſuch a one as the ſalvation of mankind ought depend on; ſuch a one as wil not only endure the Teſt of wiſe &amp; honeſt judgments, but muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52610:10"/>
be proof againſt all cavils of all ſorts of critical wranglers, makes me ſuſpect your conjectures were not throughly and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly lookt into. Firſt, I doubt the publike care, you ſuppoſe, and perſecution agree not well together: What ſanctuaries, what places free from ſearch, were there for the publike care to ſecure theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Monuments in? What ſafety could there be for their writings, whoſe perſons were in perpetual hazard? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily they muſt have been intruſted to the fidelity of private men, which, let us for once ſuppoſe, did always remain unviolate, and never betray their truſt to any hope or fear, 'tis hard to imagine it could ſo preſerv them from the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hazards neceſſary to be met with, from ſo many enemies in ſo long a time, as that no alterations ſhould creep into the Text. For, (to bar malice and all wilful faults, both the devotion of private Chriſtians would require, and publike prudence, the better to preſerve it, would endeavour as great a multiplicity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies as might be. Theſe Copies muſt of neceſſity be made in haſt and fear, and what enemies they are to exactneſs, 'tis
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52610:11"/>
needleſs to inſiſt on. Now in after times what ſhall hinder theſe Copies from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with their Originals in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if, (which the influence of chance muſt ſometimes needs bring to paſs) the Originals come to be loſt, and the Copies remain, what reaſon ſhall prefer one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another? As for the true Originals, the very Writings, I mean, ſent from the Apoſtles, they cannot be imagined able to wraſtle with ſo great an Age, eſpecially if we reflect the reverence univerſally born the Apoſtles, and deſire to ſee what proceeded from them, expoſed them to the view and handling of ſo many, that they could not fail in a ſhort time to be much worn. What publike uſe they were of in the Church, eſpecially when there was no publike face of a Church, and the pieces ſent to one citie, were unknown in another, (perhaps for a good while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written) is ſomething troubleſome to gueſs, and at beſt, but pure gueſs. And for what you ſay laſt, that many of the beſt Copies ſurvived many Ages, and ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this day; I ſhould have been glad if you had acquainted me with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why you ſo confidently affirm, what

I doubt you do but <hi>gratis</hi> ſuppoſe: For what ſigns, what proofs to ſatisfie you, do theſe Copies bring that they truly deſerve the Authority they pretend to; that they were of the number of thoſe beſt, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by publike care; In fine, that they are not even fuller of faults then thoſe which they would have corrected by them?</p>
                  <p n="7">¶. 7. <hi>Again, there's a very good way to diſcern the beſt, by thoſe ſeveral Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that have been made in or nigh the Apoſtles times of the Bible in Arabick, Syriack, and other Languages.</hi>

                  <p n="7">¶. 7. Now for Tranſlations, I ſhould conceive the greater the variety of Tranſlations is, the greater muſt the confuſion be: Since certainly where they differ, as Tranſlations of neceſſity muſt do, no one language bearing all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of another, there lyes a ſuſpition, the Tranſlation has bin made out of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent copies, whereof that which you have not, may, for ought you know, be better then that you have. Then again, why ſhould one Tranſlation yeeld to another? and who ſhall determine whether the fault belong to the Arabick for example, or the Syriack? So that what you have

                  <p n="8">¶. 8. 2. <hi>To me this is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there is no ſuch great corruption in our Original Copies; All thoſe Fathers which I have read (which are chiefly of the firſt, ſecond, and third Centuries) agree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent well (though not exactly) in their manifold quotations out of Scripture, with our preſent Copies: Some corruptions there are, but nothing nigh what is imagined; the Bible was not before Printing every mans Money (as Mr.</hi> White) <hi>therefore not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as now, and ſo not liable to many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beſides being exceeding dear, they muſt needs look to have them well done for their great price, but eſpecially thoſe Copies which were procured by a whole Societie for their publike uſe, or thoſe preſerved in publike Libraries.</hi>

                  <p n="8">¶ 8. How numerous the Quotations are, which you have obſerved, I cannot tell: but muſt needs think it ſtrange eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſhould be game that riſes. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, ſhould I preſſe to know the number of Fathers you have read, and of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52610:12"/>
places whoſe agreement you have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, what account could your good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument yield? There be millions of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in the Holy Scriptures: have you obſerved agreement in a ſingle million? nay in 100. in 50. in 40? I ſpare your modeſty, and go no lower; but beg you to reflect what it is which you call a good argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe there is ſome kind of agreement, of ſome few places, in ours, with more Antient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which for any thing we know may be corrupted too, and theſe places I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not concerning our diſputes; Therefore the whole Book is evidenc'd to be ſo free from corruption in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Salvation of mankind may ſecurely rely upon it. Next 'twould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford much matter of diſcourſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how an agreement in Quotations ſhould be excellent, and not exact? for certainly it is a pretty odd kind of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which wants exactneſs. 3ly. How does it appear but that the agreement, ſuch as it is, proceeds from this, that our Tranſlators have conformed their Tranſlations, to the Fathers Quotations? In which caſe here may very well be an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52610:13"/>
agreement with the quoted places, but no likelyhood of inferring any with the reſt. But I inſiſt upon this, that ſince you acknowledge ſom diſagreement, and ſome corruptions, it is not poſſible you ſhould rigorouſly, and critically crime the Innocence of any one place in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſſe of all that are neceſſary to the Salvation of mankind. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Printing there were fewer Bibles, I conceive true, but not that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

As much care too is now us'd of the preſſe, as could be then of the Copyer, and yet Errata's, there ſtill be, and will be while man is man, and ſubject to the Laws of tranſitory things.

Yes, but they could not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, becauſe their Adverſaries would have diſcovered the foul play.

                  <p>Now, it being, as I conceive, very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that corruptions have been made, and that willingly too: I would fain know, what ſhall hinder a corrupt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie from out-living the Books written to diſcover the corruption, and pleading in after ages, its antiquity for a title to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, with as much likelihood as the trueſt Copie in the world? while there is nothing but the bare words of either to diſcern betwixt them? But you think the diſcovery of the corruption would fruſtrate the end of him that makes them, not conſidering that theſe baits are laid for ſimple onely, not learned men, whoſe

                  <p n="10">¶. 10. <hi>All that plauſible diſcourſe of the poſſibility of Scripture-corruption only teacheth me warineſs and diligence to uſe all means, withall confirming my Faith that it is the Word of God, ſeeing ſo many contrary minds could never have combin'd to forge it, nor thoſe various Lections crept in, had it not been univerſally in reſpect of time and place received.</hi>

That ſomething was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Writing by divine Authority, you gather well; but that the Books we have and as we have them, are that ſomthing, is, if it be part of your Faith, what you will not find any thing able to confirm.

and following Sections of the 2d.

So that the Queſtion there ſeems not to be of the method how to underſtand the Scripture, but of this, whether they may be underſtood with that certainty which in our buſineſſe is requiſite.</p>
               <p n="2">¶ 2. <hi>Here I wonder at the excellent Mr.</hi> White, <hi>not to have prevented this my dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; that the ſame difficulty lies as heavy, yea heavier upon Tradition, for that came by the ſame way (as you will confeſſe) first delivered in thoſe Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Tongues, and muſt be Tranſlated (by word of Mouth) and Expounded even into our Native Languages, before we can be made ſenſible of them; and is it not as hard for me, to tell you that in Engliſh, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother told me in Latin, as for me (or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better learnt than my ſelf) to Tranſlate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52610:17"/>
ſo much written to my hand in Latine, into Engliſh, ſurely this later is the exacteſt way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">¶ 2. Here you muſt give me leave to wonder too, but 'tis that you raiſe ſuch a difficulty, and attribute ſo much heavineſs to it upon ſo light ground: Truly, I am ſo far from confeſſing that Scripture and Tradition came by the ſame way, that I conceive it impoſſible they ſhould do ſo: For Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a determinate number of words, which are the ſame to whoever reads them; Tradition is not at all confin'd, but uſes fewer, and more obſcure to ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons; more, &amp; clearer to thoſe who are duller, and conſequently is not ſubject to tranſlation; ſince certainly I cannot be ſaid to have tranſlated, if what another hath told me in 500 words of French, I tell you in 100 of Engliſh: What you aſſume therefore, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was firſt delivered in the Original tongues, is in this ſenſe true, that it was firſt preached to thoſe Nations, whoſe Vulgar Languages were thoſe which we call Original, but that gives you no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to add, 'twas tranſlated into ours, it being delivered neither to them nor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52610:18"/>
us in a ſet form of words, which might be tranſlated, but ſo preached to both in our ſeveral Vulgar Languages, that the people underſtood the meaning of what their Preachers delivered to them, and were not left to gueſs at it by ſcanning the various, and therefore doubtful, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words, they expreſs'd it in. So that Tradition is not ſubject to any of the uncertainties which writing cannot be exempt from; a truth, which the next word, <hi>expounded,</hi> ſeems to confeſs. For it being the buſineſs of Expoſition to render the Text clear, if the Goſpel were by tradition expounded to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there muſt have been a great fault in the Expoſitor, if there remained any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty or doubt in them.</p>
               <p n="3">¶. 3. <hi>You will ſay perhaps not the words, but the ſenſe was delivered by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at firſt in ſeveral expreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Yet ſtill by words liable to all thoſe difficulties incident to Scripture, yea greater, when they again tranſmit it to others of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language. Scripture too has the ſame truths eſſential to Chriſtianity in divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, ſeveral places almoſt in every Book; and whether this be not the ſurer way of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52610:18"/>
truths, let</hi> Papias <hi>his example wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who pretended to hear the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves teach the Doctrine of</hi> Millenaries, <hi>had he tranſmitted the very words in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, others, having judgement which he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as</hi> Euſebius, <hi>would have ſeen his miſtake, by this appears in general, Writing the ſureſt way,</hi> Litera ſcripta manet.</p>
               <p n="3">¶ 3. 'Tis true then, that not a ſet form of words, but a determinate ſence came down to us by Tradition, by the means of words indeed, but not as you ſay, liable to all thoſe difficulties inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Scripture. For though words are neceſſary to both, yet there is this difference, that in Traditon, where, by the obſervation of the Maſter, or notice of the Scholler any doubt is perceived, 'tis preſently explicated by other words, till it be perfectly taken away, and the thing underſtood: Whereas Scripture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to thoſe preciſe words it contains, concerning which if either your ſelf have any doubt, or another raiſe it in you, you have no means of ſatisfaction; for how can you come to the knowledge of the thing ſignified, while you are at a loſs about the ſign? that ſign, which is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52610:19"/>
all you have to truſt to, being to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate another thing, not it ſelf. Now, if you reflect that the Goſpel was preacht, or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>livered by word of mouth, with that care and time, that it was not only well underſtood by the people, but ſetled deeply in their ſouls, by a conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and high eſteem; you will ſee that ſince they underſtood the doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, and could not forget it by reaſon of their conſtant practiſe, nor loſe it by reaſon of their multitude, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has not one of the difficulties made to Scripture. This advantage too, which orall delivery has above writing, ought not be forgotten, that the livelineſs of the voice, and aptneſs of the geſture, and ſuch companions of words fitly pronounced, do infinitely contribute to make them be underſtood. We ſee Ironical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions differ no otherwiſe from ſerious ones, then in the motion of a lip or eye, and yet how vaſt is the difference? Nay, the actions of the ſpeaker ſuited to, and joyned with the circumſtance in which he ſpeaks, is perhaps of all Interpreters the beſt, and admits the leaſt doubt of his meaning. Writing therefore, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52610:19"/>
wanting theſe helps, muſt of neceſſity want alſo a moſt effiacious means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the words it preſents to the eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, which theſe enjoy that are convey'd to us by the ear. That Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture has couched in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> moſt, if not all truths eſſential to Chriſtianity in divers Expreſſions, I conceive to be true; but if you will compare it to Tradition, you muſt add, that theſe truths are indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledged, and practiſed both with conſtancy, and high eſteem by a multitude, and I ſhal then not think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Tradition, with which perhaps 'twill be the very ſame. And for the example of <hi>Papias,</hi> I am ſure it is nothing againſt me, it being evident there want the conditions neceſſary to Tradition: <hi>Viz.</hi> Of being openly and conſtantly preached to ſuch a multitude, as can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly witneſs of it, that perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and practiſe according to it: And I think it makes for me, ſince in all likelihood the error proceeded from this, that the words uſed in diſcourſe by the Apoſtle, were miſ-underſtood by ſome of the hearers; and what hapned to them when they were ſpoken, I know nothing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52610:20"/>
can hinder them from being liable to, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are written: So that even that example concludes that all error proceeds from the deceitfulneſs of ſet words, which Tradition not being tied to, is alſo freed from the inconveniences they are the occaſion of.</p>
               <p n="4">¶ 4. <hi>We may to our comfort remember, this Age affords ſuch as are as well skilled in the Originals, yea, letter then many Learned men, that lived ſeveral hundreds of years before us. I confeſs (what they are forced to acknowledge) ſome things we cannot yet know, by reaſon of thoſe difficulties: No more could the Church for above</hi> 12 <hi>hundred years ago, yet as then ſo now, we have ſufficient, though not all, light to ſalvation only out of Scripture. Becauſe we cannot underſtand all things (ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of in Scripture</hi> S. Peter <hi>tells us are hard to be underſtood) ſhall we ſay we can underſtand nothing certainly? Why ſhould we doubt our Saviour was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>more then that we underſtand any ſentence we hear commonly from one another, although there be no other way then Scripture to know it. We make no doubt but we understand a place of</hi> Plato, Ariſtotle, Tully, <hi>&amp;c. and cannot God write as intelligibly?</hi>

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52610:20"/>¶ 4. What the learning is of men of this age, I conceive very unneceſſary to examine, eſpecially ſince all the uſe you make of it, is to affirm confidently, <hi>That we have ſufficient light to ſalvation onely out of Scripture;</hi> to which all I ſhall return, is, that ſo critical an Exceptor againſt Arguments, ſhould not himſelf uſe for one, the Concluſion barely ſaid over. That <hi>we can underſtand nothing certainly,</hi> is not Mr <hi>Whites</hi> Poſition, but that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand enough for the ſalvation of mankind with certainty requiſite to that effect, and till you ſay ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, I have nothing to ſay againſt you. Why we ſhould doubt of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours being born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> I know not, and were there no other Readers of Scripture, but ſuch as you, and I, perhaps none would; but if any do, as I think <hi>Helvidius</hi> did, and you have no other means of convincing him but by words, which a ſubtle Critick will ſhew are capable of other ſenſes; pray how will you hinder a multitude, with whom an opinion of learning, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has gotten him credit, from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into damnation? of the parity

between Scripture and <hi>Aristotles</hi> writings you will give me occaſion to ſpeak more fully by and by.</p>
               <p n="5">¶ 5. <hi>Surely God would be underſtood by all, ſeeing he commands all not only to read his Law, but to write it upon their poſts and doors and Phylacteries, and be continually talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things that are neceſſary for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Deut. 6.7. <hi>and by his Apoſtles, tells us, that he intends ſo to doe, not always to ſpeak in Parables,</hi> John 16.25, 26. <hi>and in</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2, 3, 4. <hi>not handling the Word of God deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God, but if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that beleeve not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> Prov. 8.9. <hi>They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge; but what more plain then that in</hi> Hab. 2.2. <hi>And the Lord anſwered me and ſaid, Write the viſion, and make it plain upon Tables, that he may run that readeth.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52610:21"/>
what I am maintaining: The <hi>Dialogues</hi> ſay, Equivocation, the nature of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal tongues, their being ceaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an uncertainty of the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and you reply that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Law to be written upon Poſts, Doors, and Philacteries; that he intended to ſpeak to his Apoſtles without Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not handle the word of God deceitfully, that the words of wiſdom are plain to him that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth; and that the Prophet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write a Viſion plain: Does any of this, or all prove that equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brings in no incertainty, or that it and the reſt, are not found in Scripture? This is what I conceive it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to have ſpoken to, every thing elſe being not the Queſtion. But to ſpeak minutely to each, I muſt tell you, the Comments I have ſeen upon what you urge out of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> apprehend the command mentioned not to intend ſo much a literal obedience (for certainly all could not read, every one had not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries, &amp;c.) as it indeavoured to make it the buſineſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſink the Law into their hearts by a perpetual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52610:22"/>
and high eſteem. But the Queſtion is not, Whether the Scripture be not plain enough for the intent for which it was made; (you know the Dialogues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Motives of the love of God and our neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are eaſily found in the Bible, by a diſcreet reading, and not only that, but a man may by ſuch a reading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a perfect beleeving Catholick) but whether it were intended for the effect which you attribute to it, <hi>Viz.</hi> to be the rule of Faith, that is, alone to ſecure the paſſage for all mankind to heaven, when ſtrength of wit, ſtrength of malice, and ſtronger then both, the weakneſs of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and repugnance of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all joyn to ſtop it up. This we deny, and not but that Scripture may have been well enough underſtood when 'twas firſt written: For certainly, while the Circumſtances laſt in which, and for which 'tis made, it is much eaſier to comprehend the meaning of a writing, then afterwards when they being paſt, we are left to gueſſe at the ſenſe without other help then the bare letter, which we are apt to interpret every one his own way. 'Tis true therfore that Scripture was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52610:22"/>
intended to be intelligible to thoſe to whom it was written, but not to after Ages without other means. To exemplifie in the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection runs, did not the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> (not to mention the reſt of their Sects) both admit the Scripture, and yet ſo far diſagree in underſtanding it, that many times they were both wrong? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I have you reply, They were out, in things only of leſs concern, in not fundamentals; for beſides that this, would you but determine what a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental were, might be ſhew'd to be falſe, it gives no ſatisfaction to the Argument, although admired for true; ſince unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably God did not write any thing at all, with deſign to inſtruct the Reader, fundamental, or not fundamental, which he would not have underſtood; 'twere blaſphemy to impute ſuch folly to him; if then they failed in any thing, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not ſomething which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhould be underſtood. 'Tis therefore in my opinion, very clear, that his intention laſted no longer, then the circumſtances which accompanied the action, and which being paſt, the bare
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52610:23"/>
letter was no longer ſufficient without other helps, their conſtant practice, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the beſt Interpreter of a Law, which while they adhered to it, kept them right in all things commended by it, and by it the ſenſe of the letter was cleared to after Ages, which to the firſt, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently determined by other circumſtances; although not ſo but that, even then, it was to a wrangling Caviller very poſſible to be wreſted, as the example of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings undeniably evince of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. The following one from <hi>John</hi> 16. ſeems farther from the purpoſe: For how can you deduce any thing relating to it out of this, That our Saviour told his Apoſtles, the time was coming when he would ſpeak to them without Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? I conceive he means the fortie days converſation with them after his Paſſion, in which, becauſe he made them fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he ſaid, will it ever follow that every one fully and certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what is written? Farther off, if a greater diſtance may be, is what you cite from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> where the Apoſtle having in his abſence, been defamed by ſome pſeudo-Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> juſtifies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52610:23"/>
himſelf, and his fellow labourers, affirming they performed their Obligation of preaching the Goſpel ſincerely and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly; which what it has to do with our Queſtion, indeed I cannot imagin. That from the <hi>Proverbs</hi> (if it may be meant of the Scripture, which I doubt it cannot, the Text ſeeming very plain againſt that ſenſe) is againſt you; for it requires an aptitude and promptneſs in the Reader, which is to confeſs, where theſe qualities are not, the plainneſs, you urge, muſt alſo vaniſh. Now ſince theſe diſpoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not with pride and obſtinacy, and in controverſies of Faith, hereſie muſt of neceſſity take one of the parts, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie cannot be without pride and obſtinacy, nothing can be plainer then that theſe diſpoſitions cannot be in the Readers on both ſides, and that Scripture by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is no effectual weapon againſt one of them. As for the laſt, it is I think fartheſt of all, the command ſignifying no more then this, that whereas Prophecies uſe to be couched in myſterious language, the Prophet was directed here to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and write the viſion plainly, that is, not myſteriouſly: Your plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52610:24"/>
therefore ſtands thus, that becauſe one viſion was commanded to be written not miſteriouſly, therefore the bare let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture is a ſufficient means to as much certainty as is neceſſary to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mankind, which is plainly, no argument at all.</p>
               <p n="6">¶. 6. <hi>Truths neceſſary are plain enough, though others only profitable be not all ſo, nor is it requiſite, ſeeing God hath not thought good they ſhould be all ſo, elſe he would have made them plain too, indeed to them that are not duely qualified, what will be plain? A man ſhut his eyes against any thing, but let a man come with a good minde, ready to fetch, not bring any meaning, obſerve the drift of the place, what went before, what followes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare obſcure with plain places, heartily pray unto God; ſuch a man will certainly ſee what ſhall be ſufficient for his Salvation, if he live accordingly.</hi>

I ſee not the impoſſibility, I would you would be pleaſed to teach me; All that the Apoſtles taught and delivered to their Succeſſors, were all truths, and were they not ſufficient to be a Rule to Judge by, whether written or by word of mouth? I think all thoſe truths they delivered were a ſufficient Rule, for their Succeſſors could have nothing elſe to Judge by, except they pretend to an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit; well, then could not all of that truth be written which was delivered, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, for I know not any thing one man may ſpeak to another by word of mouth, but he may write it, therefore it is poſſible ſuch a ſufficient Rule may be made (I prove now only the poſſibility) and if it may, his Aſſent is due to our Doctrine, becauſe he proteſts to have no other imaginable ground, that could avert his will from giving it the function of ſupreme and ſole Judge.</hi>

               <p n="7">¶. 7. The next Paraph oppoſes a pair of Aſſertions, which ſince I know not whoſe they are, I hope you will not take it amiſs, if I do not engage my ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. 'Tis well, if I can preſerve Mr. <hi>White</hi> himſelf from ſo ſtrong an enemy as you are. For the Poſitions themſelves
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52610:25"/>
I conceive the ſecond abſolutely falſe, and that a Writing may be contrived with much more perfection, that is fitneſs to be a Rule, then the Scripture is. And for the firſt (though I conceive it true, as the caſe ſtands, ſo many uncertainties from ſo many ſeveral cauſes unavoidably crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the writing we have) yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly to examine whether a writing may not be framed without them, is a Queſtion ſo little to our purpoſe, that I beſeech you give me leave to ſay no more of it, then that while we have no better words, nor better skill in ordering them then yet are known, tis to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no one Book will be exempted from the face of all, even thoſe which by deſign are the plaineſt, as Laws, which no induſtry could yet contrive ſo but that the moot-caſes bear a notable proportion to the reſolv'd ones: As for their diſcourſe, 'tis agreed that Truths are a ſufficient rule to judge by, provided they be ſufficiently, that is, certainly known to be Truths. 'Tis alſo agreed, they may be written; but we deny the ſenſe of that Writing can always ſufficiently be made out by its bare Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, without other aſſiſtance; and this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52610:26"/>
which yet is our onely queſtion, your diſcourſe takes no notice of, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be truth, and to be known to be truth, is the ſame thing, roves, handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed, but yet roves.</p>
               <p n="8">¶ 8. <hi>Again, to prove Scripture may be a Supream rule, to decide all neceſſary controverſies, I pray anſwer me, Whether the determinations of your Councils can end controverſies? I ſuppoſe you affirm it: Thoſe determinations are printed by you, to be read by all, and be ſuch a Rule, can they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood? I have read of two of your Doctors both preſent at the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>oppoſe each other, and alledge the decree againſt each other, ſo that your determinations are not always ſufficient, no, nor ever can they be, if what you affirm of Scripture be true,</hi> Viz. <hi>inſufficient to determine: For ſuppoſe your decrees moſt plain, how ſhall I be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this is the meaning of thoſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, If I cannot, till a further deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination come out to explain the firſt, I ask again, How I ſhall be certain that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and have the right meaning of this ſecond? What by another determination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Why ſo, I ſhall be querying</hi> in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>and never be ſure, unleſs I reſt in ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52610:26"/>
one determination which may be ſufficiently intelligible to me, to ſatisfie and aſſertain me of the truth, and if Mans writings can be a determination and ſufficient Rule to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get certain truth in me, why not Gods?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">¶. 8. The Parity, you next urge, betwixt Scripture and Councels, I ſhould think of great force, if there were nothing but the bare letter in both. But in the former the word is the only interpreter of the ſence, in the later, the word is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſence: in the firſt, the ſence is to be accomodated to the word, in the 2d. the word to the ſence. To explicate my ſelf, be pleas'd to reflect, That Biſhops going into Councel, go not to find out a faith which before they knew not, but to certifie that which they already know, Then, before they agree upon words to expreſſe it by, they have in their heads that which they would expreſſe: and when the words are agreed on, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know what they mean by them, and in which of the ſences, if they be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more than one, they are to be taken in. This they teſtifie by their practiſe when they are out of Councel, and ſo leave to their poſterity, not only a Rule,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52610:27"/>
but a Method to preſerve it from being wreſted by the craft, and perverſeneſſe of their Adverſaries. Now in Scripture the caſe is quite different; There are none to tell you the ſence of the word in queſtion, neither can the word it ſelf help you, for 'tis of it you doubt. In our caſe too, 'tis interpreted quite againſt the common practiſe, and therefore (which give me leave to hint by the way) the interpreter ought not to be contented the word may bear his ſence, but muſt evidently ſee it can bear no other.</p>
               <p>For he that leaves the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to which the word may be accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, when his Salvation depends upon the choice, for this that the word may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be accomodated to another ſence, I doubt apprehends but ſlightly the value of his Soul, and what it is to be eternally, or happy, or miſerable. But this by the bye. The printed determinations therefore of Councils barely are not our Rule, but the printed determinations underſtood and practiſed; And were the Scripture ſo qualifi'd, I know not what condition it would want neceſſary to a Rule. In the mean time the inſtance of the Tridentine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52610:27"/>
Doctors ſeems to be as much againſt you as a Thing can be: for what poſſibility of certainty from words, when the very ſame are cited in behalf of contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and if a verbal foundation be found weak in Councils, how can you think 'twill ſuſtain a building of Scripture? Though in this particular caſe the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent has nothing of wonder, ſince the Council abſtaining, as far as I remember, purpoſely, from determining either ſide, and ſpeaking abſtractedly, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leave a colour for both, and a latitude for wit and fancie to work on, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which ſide they pleaſe.</p>

               <p n="1">¶ 1. The next Reaſon begins with a Queſtion, which as you ſtate it, has no oppoſition to the <hi>Dialogues,</hi> for after they have ſhewn how points of Religion may be decided, and controverſies determined by Scripture, me thinks it ſhould not be queſtioned whether that may be done, which they ſhew how 'tis done. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt you, though you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, is of the certainty of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Controverſies; their Poſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That a diſcreet and diligent peruſal of Scripture will make a man a perfect Catholick, but not with that ſteady firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to be able to evince his Religion before a Critical Judge, againſt a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and craftie Adverſary; and this is your task to oppoſe, if you will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Dialogues.</hi> To the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Maſter <hi>White</hi> glances at in his fifteenth <hi>Encounter;</hi> you anſwer, he proves not what he ſays of ſixteen hundred years, which is true; but ſure to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts that place, which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not to treat the Queſtion, and onely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52610:29"/>
mentions it by the by, will not ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a large proof: Yet if you deſire to ſee one, his <hi>Tabulae Suffragiales</hi> will ſerve you, where he handles that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on largely.</p>
               <p>And for what you ſay, ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> time that many points have been reſolv'd by Scripture, though he ſpeak of Points controverted betwixt Catholicks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and ſo your Poſition does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thwart him, yet I conceive you are in the wrong, and doubt whether any one point ever have been reſolv'd amongſt the adverſaries of the Roman Church meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Scripture: 'Tis true, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in which they all agree, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes with them, as thoſe you inſtance in; but not becauſe Scripture has reconciled their differences concerning them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never owned any differences to reconcile. Conſult Hiſtorie faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially, and if you find one ſide ever plainly convinced another, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally any other agreement then this, that the Point controverted belonged not to ſalvation, and ſo either part permitted to keep their own opinion, I ſhall learn ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of you, which yet I am yet ignorant

of. Mean while the points, yon ſay are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, I conceive, are ſo onely, becauſe they have not been queſtioned; whereof I take the reaſon to be the nature of man, which being accuſtomed to any one thing, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to the oppoſite but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and time, a quality which grounds that Maxime, <hi>Nemo repente fit peſſionus.</hi> So I conceive that <hi>Luther,</hi> being brought up &amp; long inured to Religion, though Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion obliged him to renounce ſome points of it, yet was withheld by the courſe of nature from following his Principles whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would at laſt have brought him, into infidelity. His ſucceſſors ſtill went farther, and I do not ſee that where they exceeded him, either himſelf in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, or Schollers after him were able to correct and bound them by Scripture; but that every one had as fair a plea for deſerting him, as he for deſerting the Church: Whether the Clew would have brought him, had he purſued it far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the fifth Monarchy and Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm will inform you; which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may look on but as Baſtards, and think it ſtrange they ſhould be laid to his charge, yet I cannot tell any thing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52610:30"/>
ſhould hinder you from acknowledging them his iſſue, but their deformity; for they profeſs Scripture as much as he, and have by his principles and example as great a liberty to interpret it. You will ſay they err in their Interpretation: True, but ſo did he, and as long as they follow what ſeems the truth to them, they do all that he did; and if that ſeeming be a Plea for him againſt poſſeſſion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſee not how you can deny it them. Againſt ſome of theſe, and perhaps this Labyrinth has many more windings we are yet unacquainted with, 'tis poſſible you may have occaſion to diſpute ſome of the points you conceive agreed of: and till experience ſatisfie you of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, you would do well not to be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the favour of Scripture: In the mean time pray do not take that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, which was never diſputed.</p>
               <p>As to what you ſay, that we refuſe to be ruled by Scripture, you do us wrong, for by acknowledging it the Word of God, we bind our ſelves to accept whatſoever can be proved it teaches; ſo that if it be true, as you ſay that your Religion may be convinced out of Scripture, your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52610:30"/>
over us is certain. Nay we have one Copie too, which to us is authentical, and which in Diſputation we refuſe not, whereas, when you are preſſed you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lie from one to another: And how you, that pretend to rely on Scripture, can have fairer play ſhewn you, then a Book brought, which your Adverſary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be Scripture, and profeſſes an abſolute obedience, and ſubmiſſion to whatever it ſays, indeed I cannot imagin.</p>
               <p>Since then nothing more can be required on our ſides, pray charge us not with ſuch injurious ſcandals; and take it not amiſs, if I tell you with that plainneſs, which in concerns of the ſoul, being a duty of Charitie, ſhould never be look'd upon as a breach of civility, that what you ſo loudly call the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and with the Majeſtie of ſo great a Name, endeavour to dazle your adverſaries eyes, while in truth you blind your own, proves, when faithfully and ſeverely ſcan'd, no other thing, but your own meer fancy, to which you accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the outward Word in which the true Word of God is contained, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you can do ſo, break communion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52610:31"/>
with us, becauſe we prefer another ſenſe, which the words alſo agree withall, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our conſtant and univerſal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and which to leave upon no better inducement, I muſt confeſs I know not how to excuſe from downright madneſs. Moreover, ſome of our Controvertiſts, laying down in condeſcendence to you, their own aſſured Arms, Tradition, have engaged with you at your own weapon, critical handling of Scripture; of whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, I am content almoſt even partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it ſelf ſhould be Judge, being very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident no Byas can be great enough to draw a reaſonable nature, ſo far wide of Truth, as to pronounce us, in that kind of war, overcome.</p>
               <p>When you ſay Tradition has not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded controverſies, you expreſs where the fault lies, <hi>Viz.</hi> in that not acknowledging them, it being unpoſſible that Judge ſhould end a difference, whoſe ſentence is refuſed by either of the parties: But then this is not for want of neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in him, but ſubmiſſion in them: We refuſe not to make Scripture ſole Judge out of fear it ſhould give ſentence againſt us; we know its ſence much better then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52610:31"/>
you, and know 'tis for us, and if you think you can convince us by it, do it, we both muſt and will ſubmit; but out of fear, by its not giving ſentence at all, our diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould never come to an end. We earneſtly long to ſee all the ſheep of Chriſt quietly ſeeding again in one fold, and that unhappy wall of diviſion, which ſo long has ſeparated them, battered down; and becauſe we do ſo, cannot but teſtifie Scripture is no fit Engine to do it: 'Twas to us ſhe was given, not to you, and we know her efficacy is more in times of peace, then War; that ſhe is more proper to increaſe charity, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith; and that being principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſanctifie the faithful, ſhe does ordinarily require they ſhould firſt be faithful, that they may afterwards be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. Had you the ſame diſpoſition to peace, you would either effectually ſhew the Scripture a ſit Judge to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, critically and frowardly handled, or appeal to ſome other: for he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a deſire of an end, in order to which he will obſtinately beleeve thoſe to be means, which both from reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he may learn to be none, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52610:32"/>
will not be brought to uſe other, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to do no more then barely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</p>
               <p n="2">¶ 2. <hi>Reaſon, in things that depend upon it, is often a ſufficient rule, yet many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to an agreement by it even in things which are evident &amp; by others demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; ſhall we then think it ſufficient to diſprove it a rule becauſe ſome, yea many are not made to accord with it?</hi> Mr. White <hi>p.</hi> 153. <hi>grants the Jews might have been (though they were not) led to Chriſt and ſalvation by Scripture, if they had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it with charity and humility: And</hi> p. 110. <hi>However the marks of the Church are apparant enough in Scripture, if there want not will in the ſeeker to acknowledg them: If this be not to contradict himſelf I know not what is.

For, beſides the reverence we bear the Scripture, even to an abſolute ſubmiſſion to whatever it ſays, (then which you neither do, nor can do more) we alſo bring you a Book, which we ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be Scripture, that in diſputation we refuſe it not; would you do ſo much perhaps more good might be done then is, mean time this is certain, that more cannot be required of us.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">¶. 3. The next Paragraph inſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parity betwixt Scripture, and the writings of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> touching which, what you ſay Mr. <hi>White</hi> ſeems to grant, that the one is as well able to make us underſtand its meaning, as the other; I muſt tell you does but ſeem ſo, and 'tis a wonder to me you obſerved it not, the very next page, but one, to that you cite, being employ'd in ſhewing the way of writing us'd, by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> has a great advantage towards being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, over that of the Bible. But he denies not but both may be underſtood;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52610:34"/>
and that ſtuff you weave into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: That a Reader of Scripture may come to the truth, and by it judge ariſing Errors.

Shall his Humility and Charity, which introduced him, provide him too with Arms to maintain the place, and defend it againſt the aſſaults of Wit and Malice leagued together? I ſee no glimmering of ſuch a conſequence; which nevertheleſſe ſhould have been yours, for, till you are there, your Journeys end is ſtil before you.</p>
               <p>Beſides, your foundation, that all things ſufficient for Salvation are delivered in Scripture, meaning the Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is not firm, eſpecially making, as you do afterwards, every one of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels to contain a perfect ſum of what is neceſſary to be believed and practiſed; for ſome things, and thoſe neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are beleived meerly upon the account of Traditions, as the Scripture it ſelf <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe ſtrange opinions too; which, you ſay, may ſpring up, may perhaps concern
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52610:34"/>
things neceſſary to Salvation, which, if they can neither be proved nor diſproved ſatisfactorily by Scripture, plainly there is not by your method, any ſatisfaction left us in things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And for what you urge laſt, that writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten truths may be as ſtreight a Rule as unwritten ones, 'tis true, provided they be agreed on to be truths; But the queſtion is not whether written truths will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a riſing error, but whether writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten words will ſo convince the truths they contain to, whoever riſes up in error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that no Artifice ſhall be able to pervert their fidelity, and introduce another ſence into the ſame ſounds.

Rule of conferring one place with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thoſe words ought not to be underſtood of an unity of Subſtance; ſince our Sauiour elſewhere prays his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles may be one, as his Father and he are one; which evidently contradicting a ſubſtantial unity, The former words ought to yield to theſe plain ones, <hi>Pater major me eſt.</hi> 'Twas not then by thoſe words, but by the ſence of them, ſo firmly rooted in her practiſe, that neither the wit, nor power of <hi>Arius,</hi> joyn'd with a perverſe and laſting obſtinacy, could ſhake it, that ſhe decided the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and tranſmitted ſound Doctrine to her poſterity; Shee ſaw his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contradicted her ſence, delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and continued by Tradition, but no body could ſee it contradicted the words, which his wit made as favourable to him as her. By which very ſame Method (to anſwer your Queſtion in your own words) I conceive the Church would at this day confute new errors, <hi>viz</hi> by looking upon the truths firſt delivered by the Apoſtles, and ſince preſerved by her practiſe, not the words in which they were delivered.

               <p n="5">¶ 5. To the difficulty of the following Paragraph, becauſe you propoſe it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I ſhall anſwer by Replys: and to the firſt, Why the <hi>Arians</hi> were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by that Book, I anſwer, becauſe 'twas a Book, that is, a multitude of words, which having no Interpreter to protect them, could not preſerve themſelves from being wreſted into ſenſes different from what was meant by the Author. Was there not then, ſay you, Evidence enough of that truth? Yes, to humble Seekers; but to convince it to the <hi>Arians,</hi> no; Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Conviction (taking them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely) are things above the reach of meer words. But this imputes weakneſs to S. <hi>John,</hi> or rather the Holy Ghoſt; why ſo? put a Reed into a Giants hand, and becauſe with it he cannot cleave an Oak, is he therefore weak? a feeble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is no argument of the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him that uſes it: Now words I take to be very weak, and they ceaſe not to be words, whoever he be that employs them; not but that S. <hi>John,</hi> or rather the Holy Ghoſt by him, which I think,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52610:37"/>
you will not deny might have managed them much better, and made a much nearer approach to evidence, had he ſo pleaſed, or that been his aym. I ſee men write plainer every day, and God forbid I ſhould think they underſtand the uſe of words better than he that gave them the power to underſtand. Neither dare I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the contrivance of the Book to chance or imagine the works of God to be directed by any thing but his own infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom and providence. Whence then the obſcurity of that book? Truly I am not of Council with the Divinity: but believe I may ſafely aſſert thus much, that ſince the Holy Ghoſt knew what you would object, and yet choſe that manner of writing, he meant you ſhould ſee that book was not intended for a Judge of differences in Religion, to which he refus'd to give all the qualities neceſſary for a Judge, and which even a book is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>To this I foreſee you will object, that at leaſt S. <hi>John</hi> cannot be excuſed from the weakneſſe of making choice of a means by which he knew his end was not to be arriv'd at; and that to write againſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi>

when he was conſcious his writing could not prove his intent, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unneceſſary, but hurtful. To which I reply, he writ ſo, as abundantly to prove his intent, in that manner as he deſign'd to prove it, but his intent was not that his writing ſhould be a proof, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and frowardly ſcann'd, but humbly and diligently ſtudied. In the former way he had left them a much better weapon both to defend themſelves, and overcome their Adverſaries, then words can be, namely that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to deſert upon no inducements, no nor even of an Angel from Heaven; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, for the ſuperabundant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrength of the faithful, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo a confirmation of their faith by writing, intelligible enough, at the time, and to the perſons he writ, when every body knew what it was which <hi>Cerinthus</hi> objected, and his followers inſiſted on, and conſequently knew how to apply the Phiſick to the diſeaſe, and plainly ſee his pretences overborn by the Apoſtles authority. But now the caſe is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. To ſay nothing of the alteration of words and the great change which ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52610:38"/>
much time, muſt needs make, in the Phraſes, and manner of ſpeech, our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of that Hereſie is faint and dim, and to expect we ſhould comprehend what was written againſt it, equally with thoſe ages which flouriſh'd with it, is to make him, that has hardly any knowledg of the diſeaſe, as cunning in the cure, as that Doctor whoſe charge the Patient is; The Apoſtles Goſpel, therefore, was, in thoſe circumſtances, plain enough by the letter, to thoſe to whom he writ, but to us ſo dark, that except we look upon it with the ſpectacles of Tradition, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helps, we have no ſecurity of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating its ſence; though even to them it was not ſo clear, but that it was wreſtible (and much more in the time of <hi>Arius</hi>) to malicious ſubtlety and wit, which Hereticks never want. But then thoſe Hereticks, not the Scripture, were in fault, ſay you; and no body doubts but that Hereſie and fault are inſeparable: But whether they be in fault or no, the Church ought to be furniſht with Arms to defend her ſelf againſt all ſorts of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not, till they ceaſe to be in fault (when they will alſo ceaſe to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52610:39"/>
her enemies) be left ungarded; ſhe muſt be provided as well to confound the proud, as confirm the humble: And this firſt quality is that which we deny to Scripture, and if you onely attribute to it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, you oppoſe not us, neither do I know why we ſhould oppoſe you.</p>
               <p>But God has not promis'd that obſtinate oppoſers of truth, ſhall have any means of truth made effectual to them. Very true, but he has promis'd the gates of Hell, in which I doubt, theſe obſtinate men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to ſtand, ſhall not prevail againſt his Church; and I underſtand not how they can be denied to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, if that, which you would make her only guard, uncertain words, being by their craft ſeduced into a compliance with them, they may as plauſibly object obſtinacy to the Church, as ſhe to them. For that and conſtancy are diſtinguiſhed only by their alliance, or enmity with truth, and if truth cannot be made appear, as you ſay to obſtinate men, God has not promis'd it ſhall, neither can it, whether be the obſtinate oppoſers, they or the Church. Beſides, to bate thoſe inſeparable companions of Hereſie, Pride,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52610:39"/>
Obſtinacy, conſider what will, in your principles, become of ſincere, but ſharp underſtandings, people that are not yet faithful, nor ever were obſtinate, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wittie; who look upon diſputes in Religion without concern of any thing, but truth, but look that what themſelves accept for truth, be truly ſuch, and will not be put off with counterfeit ware, and take, in ſtead of truth, the partial conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of either ſide. Neither will they be denied, neither can juſtice deny them, but that they ſhould firſt ſee the truth, before they be preſt to imbrace it: Now, that Truth be ſeen to be truth, 'tis plainly neceſſary that there be no poſſibility of falſhood; there being no contradiction in the world more manifeſt then that the ſame thing, ſhould, at the ſame time, be poſſible to be falſe, and evidently true, that is, impoſſible to be falſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis equally plain that, where there is nothing to make out the truth, but words, if thoſe words be made agree to two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, neither can be made out to be truth; for you put but one cauſe, &amp; that produci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of both effects. That one may ſomtimes, ſeem the more proper, is nothing to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52610:40"/>
purpoſe: For, beſides that to offer plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to thoſe who look after truth, and can diſcern it, is to go about to allay hunger with ſteam in ſtead of meat, 'tis agreed by all parties, that many times the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acception is the true one: So by <hi>firſt-begotten</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. we both underſtand <hi>only begotten,</hi> which nevertheleſs, are in rigour very different, and 'tis the ſame of many other and univerſally of all myſtical places.</p>
               <p>To apply all to our caſe, can you deny but that he, who ſees the thing may be falſe, does not ſee it is true, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that to accept it for truth, is to wrong his nature? Conformably to your Maxime in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part, That no man muſt give aſſent without ſufficient evidence? Can you deny, that amongſt all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sects of Chriſtians, there is any one which does not, in whatever place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture you urge againſt them, find a ſence favourable to themſelves, which they make the words tolerably bear?

deſirous of truth, who ſearch and pray, and yet differ? if none of all this can be denied, conſider what a deſperately wretched principle it is, according to which there is no effectual means of truth provided, not only for obſtinate oppoſers, but neither for earneſt purſuers of it? And ſince, without the truths we ſpeak of, there is no ſalvation, and they are not to be had without being ſeen to be truths, and your principle will not let them be ſeen, being applicable alſo to falſhood, 'tis a plain caſe, that according to it theſe men, that is the moſt conſiderable part of mankind, if not in number, at leaſt in value, muſt be either Infidel, or irrational, either eternally miſerable men, or not men in their moſt important actions, for certainly who acts againſt reaſon, is ſo far not man, but beaſt.</p>

Their Tradition was a cloſe underhand conveyance from a few to a few, neither ſo many, nor ſo honeſt, as to be ſecure from miſtakes, both accidental, and wilful, and yet the cheat, if any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, remaining by the ſecrecy undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; ſo that nothing more apt to make void the Law of God then ſuch a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this: Whereas, ſince it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that what was orally delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and by them practiſed was the Law of God, you muſt either ſay we have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their practiſe, (which ſince we affirm it to be our rule, you cannot fairly do, without evidencing what you ſay) or you will have much ado your ſelves to avoid the imputation you lay upon us: for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Law is made void, as much by contradicting the unwritten, as the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word; Now if we practiſe what the firſt Diſciples, and their Succeſſors did, and what they practiſed was the Law,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52610:45"/>
clearly he that contradicts our practice cannot refuſe the company of the Scribes and Phariſees: So that while by going no farther then the empty ſound, you fancie us neer the gulf they were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in, your judgment, fixed upon the thing, and not diverted by the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe, will find your ſelves are deep in it.</p>
               <p>I cannot leave this Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admoniſhing you of a piece of foul play in the Tranſlation of the Bible, I have heard objected to your ſide, and which poſſibly may have had one effect upon your ſelf: 'Tis that Traditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes commended, ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Scripture, though the Original word be the ſame in both caſes, yet the Tranſlation varies it ſo, as, when it is taken in an ill ſence, to render it by the Word <hi>Tradition;</hi> when in a good, always to make uſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: An Artifice which, if true, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much want of ſincerity in the Tranſlators, and brings much hazard to the Reader; The avoiding of which is the true reaſon the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the uſe of Scripture in Vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52610:45"/>For the reſt I cannot ſee, but he that ſays, This is ſufficient to ſalvation, ſays, more then this is not neceſſary, and by conſequence, Salvation would not be concerned, if that <hi>more</hi> were not. What you mean by Profitable, I cannot tell: if this that ſome perſons find in ſome books what they would not in others, then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently thoſe books are neceſſary to thoſe perſons: if onely that their Faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, or ſtrengthned, either this ſtrength is neceſſary to Salvation at leaſt for ſome, and then again the books are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them; or unneceſſary, and then what prejudice to Salvation if they were burnt? So that I doubt your fancy was too much poſſeſs'd with the ſound, to give your judgement leiſure to examine the notions of the word. Your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if one be ſufficient, all are more then ſufficient, is certainly good, but you know we deny, what you muſt next ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, conceiving that neither one, nor all are ſufficient.</p>

But, what is of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, what's all this to the purpoſe? The place is brought to prove Scripture ſufficient, in the way mentioned, to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: All that concerns the queſtion of this place, is that the Jews thought they had life in the Scriptures, but ſo, as you acknowledge, that they were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and had it not; now let that be the Antecedent, and they muſt be ſtrange Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Chains, that will tye the Concluſion

to it, and make a good argument of this, The Jews had not life in the Scriptures, <hi>ergo</hi> Scriptures are ſufficient to Salvation. 'Twas indeed their own fault they had it not, and I doubt not but an humble and charitable diligence would have found in them the important truth our Saviour was inſiſting on; But to make good the concluſion, 'tis not enough one point may appear to induſtry and piety, but that all may ſo appear as to be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintain'd againſt obſtinate and crafty peeviſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Attributes of perfection given by <hi>David,</hi> none doubts to be juſtly due to the Law of God: But what is juſtly due to it, I conceive injuſtice to attribute to any thing which is not it. Now Scripture contains, but is not the Law: and as we are far from the Blaſphemy of ſuſpecting any imperfection in the Law it ſelf, ſo the place is as far from any oppoſition to us; for our queſtion is not of the perfection of the Law, (none but Atheiſts or Infidels queſtion it,) but of the perfection of the Letter in order to determine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.

but the Life and Doctrine of our Lord and thus S.</hi> Mark <hi>begins,</hi> The beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and ſo he goeth on to lay down all the neceſſary actions and doctrines of ſalvation; Can you imagin they ſhould ſet themſelves to write half a Goſpel,</hi> John 20. <hi>latter end, S</hi> John <hi>confeſſeth there were many other things done by our Saviour which he had not written, becauſe they were too many to be written, but he hath taken as many of them as are ſufficient for us, if we make the right uſe of them to bring us to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">¶ 1. You argue next from the word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and pretend the world would be deluded, if all the eſſential parts of the Doctrine neceſſary to ſalvation, were not contained in every one of the Evangeliſts.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52610:49"/>

To argue therefore, that becauſe S. <hi>Johns</hi> Book contains news concerning the way to Heaven, therefore it contains all that concerns our way to Heaven ſeems very unreaſonable; but what is more, 'tis alſo nothing to the purpoſe: For were it granted that all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation were contained in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpels, it would not follow they were ſo contained as is neceſſary, that is, accompanied with evidence enough to guide mankind ſecurely through all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes to happineſs, and yet no leſs is requiſite to make Scripture the onely rule of faith.</p>
               <p>To the Queſtion you make in the laſt place, whether the Evangeliſts can be imagined to have written half a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? I conceive your very next words are an anſwer; for I beſeech you, had S. <hi>John</hi> written thoſe many things which their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52610:49"/>
multitude made him omit, had they not all been Goſpel? So that whatever proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they bear of ½, or ⅓ or ⅛ to the things written, this is certain, he did not write all the Goſpel he knew. Yes, but he writ ſay you, all neceſſary to ſalvation, you ſay ſo, but will not take it amiſs, if your bare Aſſertion have not the force to oblige e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to think ſo, againſt the plain ſignification of the word you ground it upon: For, neceſſary to ſalvation, is not, as I ſaid before, that which the word Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel imports.</p>
               <p n="2">¶. 2. <hi>Mr</hi> White <hi>anſwers to the place firſt, S.</hi> Johns <hi>writing was not to make a compleat Hiſtory of our Saviours acts and doctrine; but only to ſpecifie ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as prove that Chriſt was the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial Son of God; to aſſert is not to prove S.</hi> John <hi>intended only,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It may be as eaſily denied, as affirmed; thats like an obſtinate Sophiſter, that intends not truth, but to ſay ſomwhat only to ſtop his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries mouth, a ſign of a bad cauſe; It is a ſufficient confutation of any new Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove it has no ground, I ſee none i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Mr</hi> White <hi>builds his Aſſertion on, unleſs he has ſome he does not expreſs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52610:50"/>
which would be ſtrange in this weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but poſſibly that Aſſertion of</hi> S.

               </p>
               <p n="2">¶. 2. You next except againſt the anſwer Mr. <hi>White</hi> gives to the 20th. of <hi>John;</hi> and firſt, that he aſſerts, but proves not, which you ſay is a ſign of a bad cauſe, a trick of an obſtinate Sophiſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But pray recollect your ſelf, and remember an Anſwerer that goes about to prove, goes beyond his bounds: To affirm, deny, or diſtinguiſh, is the whole Sphere of his activity. And when you ſay 'tis a ſufficient confutation of a new aſſertion to ſhew it has no ground; you ſay very true; but pray take along with you, that your aſſertion of Scriptures ſufficiency to the effect we ſpeak of, is the new aſſertion, unheard of in the world before <hi>Luther;</hi> and an interpretation of this place in favour of it, every jot as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52610:51"/>
new; no ſuch ſence having ever been thought of, till the neceſſity of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an unreaſonable Tenet, forced as unreaſonable an explication. If you pleaſe, prove your ground, and do not take it for granted till it be diſproved. When you have done ſo, ſhew this, which you call a new aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Whites,</hi> has no ground; for before, ſure you ought not to think it, ſufficiently confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Till then I cannot ſee why it ſhould be a ſign of a bad cauſe to believe the Apoſtle, and take his word when he tels us the deſign of his writing was that we might believe the Divinity of the Son. But you can prove the contrary with as much probabilities out of the ſame Text: if you do no more, Mr. <hi>White</hi> has done as much as he ſhould do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if both expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be probable, his Adverſary has concluded nothing againſt him. But you think you can prove it with certainty; let us ſee whether it be rational for me to think ſo; and firſt, after you have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with Mr. <hi>White</hi> for diſ-jointing the Text, (as I conceive very ungroundedly, when, except this word, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is not any way material, he cites the verſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52610:51"/>
truly) your ſelf, inſtead of ſetting it together again, deliver, not the Text, out of which you undertake to conclude, but a large Paraphraſe upon it, and this without telling us whether it be your own, or recommended by any authority, or in fine any ground why we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, and, of which, nothing is certain, but that it is not the Text; and This you call certainty. Pray Sir Remember, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, is not to prove, Remember it may be as eaſily deny'd as affirm'd, Remember ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sophiſtry, and ſigns of a bad cauſe.</p>
               <p>Next, all the uſe you make of your Paraphraſe is to eſtabliſh this concluſion, whoſe certainty too is by this time relented into <hi>ſeeming,</hi> that their having life ſeems to be his chief end. Be it ſo, as I conceive the end of all the Apoſtles, not only in their writings, but both their and their Maſters end, in all his actions was the life of Chriſtians: Sure it will not follow their life needed no other either ſuſtenance or Phiſick then this Goſpel. Be it granted it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal means to this end; that it is the only, or whole means, the place does not ſo much as offer any likelyhood of aſſerting;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52610:52"/>
nay, I ſee not how the Apoſtle can, without manifeſt violence to the Text, be made, to mean more than the one point he expreſſes, and the fruit reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from it; for certainly 'tis not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, but wreſt a Text, when the ſame word is repeated in the ſame period, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to give it one ſence in the former, another in the later place; which, yet, is the caſe here; for in the firſt part of the period, the word <hi>believe</hi> is ſo reſtrained by the Apoſtle, that it cannot, without unpardonable guilt, be doubted what it was he meant ſhould be believed, when he plainly tells us, 'tis this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Chriſt the Son of God: and the word <hi>believing</hi> preſently following, in the ſame context, and link'd to the former with a conjunction, ſincerity cannot imagine it ſhould be meant of any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, than that which, ſo immediately before, was plainly expreſſed, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, had been Tautologie. If words therefore can make any thing clear, I ſee not what place of doubt there is left, but that this is the Apoſtles meaning, that the Book was written to the end we might believe the Divinity of the Son, and, by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52610:52"/>
that belief, have life, as much as depends upon that one point; which being the foundation of all our Faith, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be therefore ſaid to give us life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatever contributes to our life, has dependance on it; for if Chriſt be no Son of God, then no ſufficient teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mankind, and if no ſufficient teacher, then nothing ſufficiently taught. Though otherwiſe, ſure life is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd more expreſly to this faith, then Salvation to eating his fleſh, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, I believe you will not ſay is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Salvation, and conſequently ſhould not that, this is enough to life.</p>
               <p>What you ſay in the laſt place, that the words do not ſhew it St. <hi>Johns</hi> chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to prove Chriſt the Conſubſtantial Son of God, how do you prove? The word <hi>Christ,</hi> which is all the Text has more than what Mr. <hi>White</hi> cites, alters not the caſe, Theſe two expreſſions. That <hi>Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> and that <hi>he is Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> not having any conſiderable difference, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more evident, then that he that believes him to be Chriſt the Son of God, believes him to be the Son of God. But
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52610:53"/>
I apprehend all this buſineſs to be nothing but the confuſion raiſed in our thoughts, by the equivocation of the word <hi>end,</hi> which may either ſignifie what S. <hi>John</hi> intended to do when he ſet himſelf to write that Book, which I conceive was to ſhew the Conſubſtantiality of the Son, or elſe what fruit he deſign'd from it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was written, and this ſeems to be the life of his Readers.</p>

And yet truly I beleeve, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were S. <hi>Johns</hi> Book examined from Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Chapter, little would be found but what does either directly prove our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Divinitie, or is ſubordinate to that end; ſome accidentals excepted, which the nature of ſuch diſcourſes requires ſhould be weaved in, and which hinder not but that the other is the only deſign.</p>
               <p>To proceed, I muſt take leave to wonder in my turn, you perſiſt to call Mr <hi>Whites</hi> Anſwer a ſhift, falſe and groundleſs, and ſay no more then you do to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo. What you next affirm to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and manifeſt, that S. <hi>John</hi> making here a recapitulation of all thoſe Doctrines and and Precepts in his Goſpel, concluding
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52610:54"/>
from all, ſhews us, that his Book is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Rule to ſalvation in all things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, if I underſtand what 'tis to recapitulate, and to conclude, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently neither manifeſt, nor true, for what words are there, that can bear the ſenſe of recapitulating, and concluding in theſe ſhort periods: Many other things here are which I have not written, but thoſe I have, I writ to the end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſignifies to ſum up the chief Heads of what was ſaid before, and to conclude is to gather ſomthing from others that went before, and here are neither heads, nor premiſes, but a bare Hiſtorical Narration informing us what the Apoſtle did, and why, which differs as much from recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating and concluding, as Hiſtory does from Logick. But, what is of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, how came you to be ſo clear ſighted, as where none elſe can perceive any Concluſion at all, to diſcover this, That his Book is a ſufficient rule to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all things neceſſary? That belief, or faith is to be underſtood of ſaving faith (which is all I can perceive you drive at to the end of the Paraph) is ſo far from it, that I do not beleeve any violence will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52610:55"/>
make a premiſe of it; for be it as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Apoſtle writ, that we might beleev in Chriſt the Son of God with a ſaving faith, and I dare ſay no Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick would comprehend the number of intermedial links neceſſary to faſten this Concluſion to it, that what he writ is a ſufficient rule to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">¶ 4. <hi>But what need I trouble my ſelf or you, with writing all I could, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an ingenuous confeſſion of yours, when we were one night diſcourſing of this place that you thought the whole Book was not only ſufficient for ſalvation, but even ſome parts of it, if a man had no more, which is as much as I deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">¶ 4. The anſwer to this Paraph de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the memory of that perſon who made ſuch a confeſſion: I conceive it true thus far, that even ſome parts might be ſufficient for the ſalvation of ſome ſingle perſon, extraordinarily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and circumſtanced, which in all likelihood was his meaning. But this is nothing to our Queſtion, whether it be ſufficient for the conduct of all diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions found in mankind, through all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the Church will be in from

               <p n="5">¶ 5. <hi>The ſecond place I look upon as a ſufficient proof of Scriptures ſufficiency, is the beginning of</hi> S. Lukes <hi>Goſpel, compared with the beginning of the</hi> Acts; <hi>In Mr</hi> Whites <hi>Apology</hi> p. 165, 166. <hi>where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms there is not a word that this Book ſhould ſerve for a Catechiſm, to teach him and all the world the entire body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, I think there is, that thou mayeſt know the certainty of thoſe things thou haſt been taught, or as the Greek word is, haſt been Catechized in. So then</hi> S. Lukes <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel contains a perfect ſum of all theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and duties which</hi> Theophilus <hi>a Chriſtian already had learnt. To me this proves</hi> S. Lukes <hi>Goſpel to be a bodie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, or a Systeme of all neceſſary truths of Chriſtianity, ſo that</hi> S. Lukes <hi>Goſpel is more then a naked Hiſtorie of Chriſts life, containing his Doctrine too, or elſe he had not given</hi> Theophilus <hi>a full account of all he had been inſtructed in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To ſay (as</hi> Mr White) <hi>S.</hi> Luke <hi>ſpeaketh but by the by of our Saviours Doctrine, or (as his words are) ſome of his excellent ſayings, is quite contrary to thoſe words of the first of the</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52610:56"/>
Acts, <hi>out of which he gathers his ſaying, for there he ſpeaks thus of his Goſpel.</hi> The former Treatiſe have I made, O <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> of all that Jeſus began both to do and to teach, <hi>which is more then (as</hi> Mr White) <hi>ſome of his excellent ſayings: I lay the ſtreſs upon theſe two words,</hi> all <hi>and</hi> teach, <hi>which</hi> Mr White <hi>paſſeth over as Commentators do hard places, although it be the chief thing to be anſwered: Another thing I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in</hi> Mr Whites <hi>tranſlation, he omits the word</hi> perfectly <hi>or exactly in the third verſe of the Goſpel, which is very pertinent. By all things Jeſus did and taught, muſt be meant the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion, the chief Doctrines and duties which were neceſſary to ſalvation, for if any material point were omitted by</hi> S. Luke, <hi>he could not alledge his exact knowledge in all things which he promiſes, nor ſay as he does in the</hi> Acts, <hi>that he had delivered all Chriſt did or taught; from whence I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (and you too, unleſs you can ſhew ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe to the contrary) that</hi> S. Lukes <hi>Goſpel, much more the whole Bible, hath ſufficient truth in it, and contains all points neceſſary to ſalvation, and may be a ſufficient means, though we have no traditions. The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52610:56"/>
Covenant between God and man is cleerly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough laid down there, and in other Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, with all thoſe things, without which no ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">¶. 5. The ſecond place you inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the beginning of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, compar'd with the beginning of the <hi>Acts:</hi> which, with your favour, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you have not brought home to our queſtion; for admit all you ſay were true, even the concluſion it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel hath ſufficient truths in it, and contains all points neceſſary to ſalvation, and may be a ſufficient means, though we have no Traditions; your cauſe is far from being evicted, For our queſtion is not ſo much whether ſufficient truths be containd in ſcripture, as whether they bee contained ſufficiently that is with evidence enough to carry away a cleer victory from malicious and obſtinate Criticiſm: So that it conſiſts very well, that all neceſſary truths may be contained, which is all you do ſay, and yet not ſo contain'd as in neceſſary for that effect, which is what you ſhould have ſaid. Again, ſince the ſame means may be ſufficient for one perſon, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52610:57"/>
are not for another, or for all, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at one time, not ſo at another; Your Concluſion that this Goſpel may be a ſufficient means without Tradition, comes far ſhort of what it ſhould be, that 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to all perſons, in all circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Now I preſume the Evangeliſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> with deſign to inſtruct him particularly, the ſufficiency you ſpeak of, cannot fairly be ſtretched farther then his intent, and be conſtrued to belong to more then <hi>Theophilus</hi> himſelf: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſince every body in the Church is not <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to deſerve a Goſpel ſhould be writ to him, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what was ſufficient for him, ſhould be ſufficient for every body elſe. You ſee then how ſtrongly ſoever your Canon is charged, I conceive the Concluſion ſafe, as placed beyond its level. But yet to try the force it has, The firſt thing you ſay againſt Mr <hi>White</hi> is, that you think the place ſhews, the Book was intended for a Catechiſm to teach him, and all the world, the entire body of Chriſtianity, moved by theſe words, <hi>that thou mayeſt know the certainty of theſe things thou haſt been taught or catechized in.</hi> I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52610:57"/>
beſeech you, how does it appear, that by <hi>thoſe things</hi> muſt be underſtood a body of Chriſtianity? You ſee Mr <hi>White</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands no more by them, then reports he <hi>[Theophilus]</hi> had heard, and tels you, if you will urge another ſenſe, you muſt firſt juſtifie it againſt this. Now evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writing to let <hi>Theophilus</hi> know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe reports he had heard, is far enough from writing a body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. As for the word <hi>Catechized,</hi> which you ſeem to rely upon, its original ſignification, (if good <hi>Grecians</hi> have not miſ-informed me) being moſt properly rendred by <hi>inſono,</hi> or <hi>infundo,</hi> imports no more then a delivery of ſomthing by word of mouth; though ſince, by Eccleſiaſtical cuſtome it hath almoſt been appropriated to the delivery of Chriſtian doctrine:</p>
               <p>Now this being ſince S. <hi>Lukes</hi> time, what it was that was ſo delivered to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> cannot be gathered from the word. But if that be true, which you ſay of <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that he was already a Chriſtian, I do not ſee the words can be brought to bear your ſenſe, ſince manifeſtly he could not have been ſo, without already being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the body of Chriſtianity. So that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52610:58"/>
your Expoſition, makes the Evangeliſt, very wiſely, take a great deal of pains, in writing a book, to inform <hi>Theophilus</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, of what he certainly knew before. Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> interpretation therefore ſeems much the more genuine, and yet, even admitting yours, I cannot, as I ſaid before, imagine any approach to our difference: For St. <hi>Luke,</hi> expreſly confining his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the inſtruction of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> hee that extends it to more, acts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly without any Warrant from him.</p>
               <p>You urge afterwards the firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which, you ſay Mr. <hi>White</hi> paſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as Commentators do hard pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Truly, your ſeverity is beyond what I have ever met with, and you are the firſt example of expecting a man ſhould anſwer more then is objected: Mr. <hi>White</hi> is ſpeaking to the Goſpel, and theſe words are in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and yet you except againſt him for taking no notice of them. As for the difficultie it ſelf, ſince thoſe words cannot be taken in their proper natural ſignification, St. <hi>John</hi> plainly telling us, the world would not be able to contain the books which might be written; I do not ſee any ground you
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52610:58"/>
have to underſtand by them the ſubſtance of Chriſtian doctrine. With ſubmiſſion to better judgments, I apprehend that by <hi>All</hi> is meant, all he thought fit to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that ſenſe ſeeming to flow naturally from the places compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together: But whether that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be true or no, I am ſure nothing appears why a man ſhould accept of yours. For whereas you would prove it out of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> exact knowledge, that is manifeſtly nothing to the purpoſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bodie ſeeing it follows not, becauſe S. <hi>Luke</hi> knew all, therefore he delivered all.</p>
               <p>And for the quarrel againſt Mr. <hi>White,</hi> for leaving out the word <hi>exactly,</hi> beſides that, as I come from ſaying, it is far from being very pertinent, exact knowing being much a different thing from exact teaching all he knew, Mr. <hi>White</hi> puts in ſtead of it, that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent almoſt at all things, &amp;c. which, in matters of fact is the moſt exact knowledg that can be: And for the ſecond proof, that otherwiſe he could not ſay he had delivered <hi>All</hi> Chriſt did or taught, I have already told you, though that word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken properly, to ſignifie truly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52610:59"/>

                  </gap> do it wrong to take it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly as you do, the ſubſtance of Chriſtian doctrine being a ſtrange Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the Latin word <hi>Omne.</hi> But be all this given to the reſpect of the perſon, which ſuffers me not to paſs by any thing you ſay, without taking notice of it, though otherwiſe your Concluſion, which I am now come to, does not any way prejudice the Tenet I am maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; To contain ſufficient truths, and to be a ſufficient means to ſalvation, (which may poſſibly be true in reſpect of ſome perſons and circumſtances) being quite another thing, then to decide all quarrels carried on by factiouſly litigious perſons, and this in all times and caſes.</p>
               <p>For a concluſion, I beſeech you to accept of this obſervation, that a ſerious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on what you do your ſelf, would ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, whether partie Truth takes in this queſtion; for whatever force, cuſtom, and a prepoſſeſt fancie has on your words, to make them maintain St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſufficient, nature contradicts them ſo powerfully, that your actions ſpeak the clean contrary, and plainly prove 'tis not ſufficient: for ſince you cannot hold, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52610:59"/>
a ſufficient means to you, which you do not ſufficiently know to be a means, and this ſufficiency of the Goſpel you do not know without the Acts, which nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you to rely upon, even while you are maintaining you need them not; you ſee plainly your words and actions agree not, and that while you would by the former perſwade the ſufficiency of the Goſpel alone, the later unreſiſtably convince ſomthing elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Acts,</hi> is neceſſary to its ſufficiency, that is, that it alone is not ſufficient.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52610:60"/>
becauſe they ſay it, therefore it is true, but becauſe we ſee no reaſon to diſ-beleeve, or have ſufficient reaſon to beleeve they teſtifie truths, as a Judge collects a truth from Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, every one of which is a fallible man, yet, by beholding circumſtances, ſees their concurrent Teſtimonies cannot be falſe; here we have ground enough to beleeve, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was a ſufficient rule to them, becauſe they ſay and confeſs it was. I am ready to beleeve any Tradition as well as the Bible, provided we have as good ground to beleeve it came from the Apoſtles, as I have of the Bible. Suppoſe it be not a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us, who beſides have Scripture on our ſide, yet it is a ſufficient Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, who pretend to derive your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from them who went before you, whom you include in your Church; (as</hi> Mr White) <hi>If the Bible had once that authority we plead for, in your Church, it ſhould have it ſtill, the contrary being a Novelty; therefore I muſt count your Doctrine falſe, till you have ſolved this Argument.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52610:61"/>
the Apoſtles by univerſal Tradition, as the Scripture it ſelf, and ſuch a Tradition I am ready to embrace: It is cleer how high he valued the Churches authority in that</hi> lib. 2. de util. cred. c. 14. <hi>This therefore I beleeved by fame, ſtrengthned by celebrity, conſent, antiquity, ſo that he did no more than we, who notwithſtanding are of a contrary mind to you.</hi>

You aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, We deny <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> Every of which words deſerves its particular reflexion, For firſt, by <hi>Scripture</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52610:63"/>
is meant either the words or ſenſe; that is, the words containing a ſenſe, ſo as that another may be found in the ſame words; or elſe a ſenſe expreſſed accidentally by ſuch words, &amp; which might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by other. By a <hi>Rule</hi> ſince 'tis our belief muſt be regulated, and our belief is of things, not ſounds, is underſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a determinate ſenſe, or certain means to arrive at it. We ſay then that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, taken the firſt way cannot be a Rule, nothing being more evident then that words, meerly as ſuch; without due quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which are not found in all words, are neither ſenſe, nor means to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a determinate one, ſince the ſame words may comprehend many ſenſes. Take <hi>Scripture</hi> the ſecond way, and the queſtion is quite changed; none denies the ſence of it to be the word of God, by which all our belief and actions are to be regulated; our Diſpute then in that caſe, is not whether it be a Rule, but how 'tis known; whether by the bare words in which 'tis couched (which we deny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other ſences are couched in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame words) or by the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity interpreting it by Tradition, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52610:63"/>
you conceived unneceſſary. To Scripture interpreted by Tradition, or the ſence of Scripture acknowledged by Tradition, we ſubmit all our thoughts and actions, but deny the title of a Rule can belong to Scripture, taken for the meer words, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenc't, that is, Characters; and conceive the ſence of Scripture cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcovered by the bare ſcanning of the words, which after all, being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of many ſences, leave it undetermined which is the true one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is to be conſidered either in reſpect of one, or ſome few men, or in reſpect of a multitude; for ſince the ſame cauſe produces not the ſame effect upon different ſubjects, 'tis not poſſible that to every of thoſe many, who are comprehended in a Church, the ſame knowledge ſhould be neceſſary: That there is a rewarder of good, and puniſher of evil, may for ought I can tell be enough for ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily diſpoſed creature to know, but mankind requires the knowledge of much more. Again outward circumſtances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely vary the diſpoſition of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. We live both in calms and ſtorms, and to day a waſhing boul will ferry me
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52610:64"/>
over the <hi>Thames,</hi> which Oars perhaps will hardly do to morrow: Now ſince he that meets with no rubs ſeldom ſtumbles, if the way be ſmooth and even, every thing overcoms it; if rugged or deep, 'tis not paſſed without much labour and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. And ſo the faithful, who live in a deep peace, need not that ſtrength of certainty, which is neceſſary for thoſe, who are aſſaulted by the outward wars of Hereſie, or inteſtine broils of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Obſerve then, if you pleaſe, what your witneſſes to gain your cauſe, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for you. That Scripture, taken for the words, teaches the Church, that is, mankind the way to ſalvation, ſo as not to need the aſſiſtance of Tradition, or any other Interpreter, to ſecure them againſt all poſſible aſſaults of all poſſible adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; or taken for the ſence, that the ſence of Scripture is ſo known by the bare words, without the help of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other Interpreter, that no ſubtlety or malice can weaken the certainty it gives of as much as is neceſſary for the ſalvation of mankind. This is what they ſhould ſay; What they do, let us now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine. But firſt you tell us, you receive
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52610:64"/>
not their Teſtimony as <hi>authoritative,</hi> but embrace both their and any other as <hi>rational;</hi> which is a peece of learning, I ſhould have been not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have met in an Adverſary I had deſired to treat like one. To you I can onely ſay, your difference to thoſe, who mint ſuch adulterate coin, is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the blind obedience with which we uſe to be reproached.</p>
               <p>Of the two ways of moving aſſent, <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> &amp; <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the one is diſtinguiſhed from the other in this, that the firſt relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of the Propoſer, whom, if we be ſatisfied he is ſo wiſe as to know what he ſays, and ſo good, as not to ſay againſt what he knows, 'tis rational to beleeve, and lay hold upon the truth he preſents us, which we ſee, with his eyes, not our own. The ſecond carries us, by the evidence of truth it propoſes, barefaced, and without any conſideration of the Propoſer, in which way we rely upon our own eyes, not another mans credit: Wherefore if you will proceed the firſt way, by Teſtimonies, they are onely, and ſo far valuable, as their Author has autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and muſt be either authoritative, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52610:65"/>
of no force at all: If the ſecond, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to cite an Author for what is conſiderable, onely in reſpect of what it is, not in reſpect of him that ſaid it, for reaſons have weight from their inward vertue, and are neither greater in the mouth of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor leſſe in the mouth a Cobler. Neither therefore can <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative</hi> be ſeparated from <hi>teſtimony,</hi> nor <hi>rational</hi> joyned to it; a rational Teſtimony in true Engliſh, ſaying a Teſtimony, which is not a Teſtimony, but a reaſon.</p>
               <p>Your 3 Paraph too has a very pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in theſe terms, that the Church is is no infallible decider, but a credible witneſs, whereas theſe two, are at leaſt in our ſubject matter inſeparable. For ſince not infallible ſays fallible, and fallible ſays that which may deceive, and credible ſays what 'tis rational to beleeve, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more irrational then to beleeve what may deceive the beleever, plainly if the Church be not infallible, neither is ſhe credible. Beſides, her power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding, in things of this nature, is founded upon her power of witneſſing, ſhe being therefore able to decide, becauſe ſhe is able to witneſs what it was which Chriſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52610:65"/>
and his Apoſtles taught her, and ſhe has till now preſerved: in which, if ſhe can credibly, that is, infallibly witneſs, ſhe can alſo infallibly decide; if her teſtimony be fallible, ſhe cannot be credible. The reſt of what you ſay, till you come to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies themſelvs, although I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet I think not neceſſary to meddle with, apprehending the concern of our diſpute to be very independent of it. But now St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>non Catholicis Epiſcopis conſentiendum eſt, ſicubi forte fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur, ut contra Canonicas Scripturas ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ſentiant.</hi> Very true, and ſure no body, at leaſt no Catholick Biſhop ever pretended to be believed againſt Scripture, that is, its ſence, concerning which, our conteſt is how tis known, and to that the witneſs ſays nothing. Again, <hi>Eccleſiam ſuam demonſtrent non in ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſed in Canonicis librorum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatibus:</hi> And, <hi>utrum ipſi Eccleſiam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant non niſi divinarum Scripturarum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicis libris oſtendant:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>non Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus haec dico, ſed haec dixit Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ibi quaeramus Eccleſiam,</hi> &amp;c. In which three places he challenges his Adverſaries, to prove their cauſe by Scripture, a courſe, not onely commendable in him,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52610:66"/>
but practiſ'd dayly by us. Several of our Books will witneſs for us, we are ſo far from thinking our cauſe loſt by Scripture, that we know it infinitely ſuperior even in that kind of tryal: but what's this to the purpoſe? Becauſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> then, and we now, know the advantage Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives us above all our Adverſaries, does therefore either he or we think the bare words of it are our Rule of faith, or that its ſence needs no other means to be found out, but the bare words? Theſe Sir are our onely Queſtions, but not ſo much as thought on by the Judges you bring to decide them. The place you bring from his <hi>Doct. Chriſt.</hi> ſeems more to the purpoſe, but yet comes not home; it being violence to extend it farther then private Readers, and theſe qualifi'd, as he expreſſes, with piety, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and fear of God: <hi>pietate manſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> (as his words are) <hi>de timentibus Deum,</hi> piouſly meek, and fearing God. And of theſe tis alſo Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> opinion, that the Scripture is plain enough to make them perfect beleeving Catholicks. But that 'tis able to conteſt with captious fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and thoſe crooked diſpoſitions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52610:66"/>
which accompany Hereſie, or ſatisfie the nice ſharpneſs of ſincere, but piercing wits, or that the plainneſs, he ſpeaks of, ought to bee underſtood with reſpect to the exigencies of the Church, that is mankind, which may be true in reſpect of ſuch excellently diſpoſ'd perſons as he mentions, are things, however neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet not at all touched.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> authority is wider; all it ſays being thus much, that where there is but one authentick Hiſtory extant of the Subject to be ſpoken of, what is not found there, has no ſufficient ground to keep it from being unblamably rejected. Which is his caſe: for there is no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Hiſtory of the actions of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but the Bible; wherefore, ſince they are no ſubject of Traditions, they muſt either deny their ground from thence, or have no ground at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullians</hi> words are plainly changed: for whereas you make him tye and, as it were, challenge Hereticks to defend their cauſe by Scripture, his words are: <hi>ut de Scripturis ſolis queſtiones ſuas ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

alone,</hi> in which, though by the od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Phraſe, the ſence be a little dark, yet this is clear, that the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is common to <hi>proving</hi> and <hi>defending,</hi> and therefore to reſtrain it to <hi>defendin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> is in the mildeſt language, manifeſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: For my part, I conceive the ſence no more but this; That Hereticks cannot prove their cauſe by Scripture. But I muſt wonder at the proceedings of your men, and by what charm they get the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of miſleading people, when 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt they chuſe to grope in the dark, when they might walk in the open light. To hook in the authority of <hi>Tertullian</hi> to their party, they take advantage here of a place, whoſe obſcurity renders the ſence hard to be determined, and eaſie to be wreſted (but not enough to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe neither, without plainly changing the words) when they cannot be ignorant he has delivered his judgement directly againſt them in as expreſs terms as words can frame in his <hi>preſcription againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</hi> I ſhall only tranſcribe two ſhort places, and recommend the whole excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Work to your ſerious peruſal. He tells us we are not to diſpute with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52610:67"/>
out of Scripture, which they have nothing to do withal, it being forbid by the Apoſtle amongſt other Reaſons, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam nihil proficiat congreſsio ſcriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, niſi plane ut aut ſtomachi quis ineat everſionem aut cerebri;</hi> becauſe <hi>bandying of Scriptures is good for nothing at all, but to turn either the ſtomack or the brain:</hi> And a little further, <hi>Ergo non ad Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturas provocandum eſt, in quibus aut nulla, aut incerta victoria eſt, aut parum certa: Wherefore we are not to appeal to Scriptures, in which the victorie is either none at all, or uncertain, at leaſt not certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you, where is the ſincerity of thoſe men who would make us beleeve <hi>Tertullian</hi> held Scripture the only rule of Faith? Or becauſe there is a wreſtible place to be found in one of his Books, 'tis his judgement of the point in queſtion, either doubtful, or poſſible to be unknown to whoever deſires to know it, and much leſſe to any that lays claim to the title of learned? S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> ſays indeed, that nothing is to be affirmed of God, which is not expreſſed in Scripture; but how? either according to the words, or according to the ſence:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52610:68"/>
which is to ſay, that ſome things, as in particular, the queſtion in hand of the Holy Ghoſt are ſo in Scripture as not to be efficaciouſly diſcovered by the words; and ſo he brings a place to prove the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, very far from unavoidable. But I forbear to urge his authority againſt you, imagining by your nice warineſs in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning him, you are ſufficiently ſatisfied he is far from your opinion in this point, and proceed to the reſt of the proofs you give a promiſe of.</p>

For how comes it that a man bred up wholly to the Arts of War and Government, and ſo lately become a Chriſtian, that he wanted even time, had his other employments been no Obſtacle, to advance beyond the degree of a Learner, ſhould yet be look'd upon by you as ſo great a Doctor, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his (which according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſuch perſons too, has more of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, then ſevere diſcourſe in it,) ſhould wholly ſway you in a point of Religion, whoſe judgment I dare ſay, in a point of Politicks, in which he was much better vers'd, would not be of half that credit with you? what if he did not ſo much as underſtand the thing? and if he did, what if he ſpoke rather according to his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions then his judgment? For Princes you know, do, and ought to govern their actions by other rules then private men, and ſpeak ſometimes more what 'tis fit
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52610:72"/>
they ſhould be heard ſpeak, then what they truly think. In either of theſe caſes, both which I take to be, not only poſſible, but ſo far probable that I think them true, how weak a ſupport is this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you ſo much rely upon? And yet I think theſe advantages ſo unneceſſary, that the place it ſelf faithfully conſulted needs no aſſiſtance to conclude plainly againſt you; For ſince you make <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſatified of the truth of the Queſtion, before the calling of the Council, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any colour be imagined he meant to put that to tryal which, before the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all appointed, was already known, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd on. The Queſtion therefore in Iſſue, could not be which was Faith, which Hereſie, neither does that uſe to be, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be a Queſtion among thoſe that know their own Faith: but how the oppoſitions made againſt the known Faith might be anſwered. And this (beſides that after a man is ſatisfied of the truth of one part of the Queſtion, there can be no more diſpute concerning the ſame Queſtion, but how to anſwer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the oppoſite) is clear from the very words: For <hi>diſſolvere</hi> does not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52610:72"/>
ſignifie to give ſentence in a Queſtion, (he that ſhould Engliſh it ſo, would wreſt it ſtrangely) but to ſolve an Argument, its natural ſignification, to looſe or untie, being applied by Schollers to the knots of Sophiſtry. That Phraſe therefore imports the anſwering an Objection, not the determining a controverſie, and the ſence of the place is this: Let us by Scripture ſhew the Arguments of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> brought out of Scripture fallacious and unconcluding.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you then to accept of this ſhort Anſwer to your long Diſcourſe; Firſt, that whatever were <hi>Conſtantines</hi> opinion, 'tis of no extraordinary impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance either way, he being a man wholly bred up to other Arts then Divinity, and by the courſe of his life diſabled from attaining a maſtery in ſuch abſtruſe points. Secondly, that yours is ſo far from appearing to be his Opinion, that you cannot force it upon the words you cite without manifeſt violence, and which their own genuine ſignification, and the conſideration of circumſtances plainly refuſe.</p>
               <p>As for that part of your ſeventh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52610:73"/>
where you deny the Council was forced to conclude out of Tradition the deſire of ſerving you makes me wiſh my ſelf a better Hiſtorian then I am: But I think the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to the <hi>Africans,</hi> which you will find in <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. will ſufficiently clear that Truth to you, ſince 'twill inform you, that whatever words the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil could chuſe out of Scripture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Catholick Faith in, the <hi>Arians</hi> knew how to elude, by ſhewing the ſame words to have other ſences in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which at laſt forced the Fathers to invent a new word, and gave occaſion to the <hi>Arians</hi> of murmuring, that they were condemned by unwritten words; that is, not by Scripture, but by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Since, what has formerly been ſaid, will I hope, be an ingenuous Anſwer to the queſtion of your eighth Paraph, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you that Tradition is not ſubject to the ſame inconveniences with words; there remains no more but to vindicate Mr <hi>White</hi> from the inconſtancy you charge him with, to which there will I think no more be needful, then barely to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52610:73"/>
repreſent the caſe to your ſecond thoughts: Our faith, you know, muſt be both beleeved and expreſſed; the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he conceives it ſit, ſhould be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and that the beſt way in order to it, is to make uſe, as much as may be, of thoſe which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture has before made uſe of. But ſince expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuppoſes the knowledg of what it is we would expreſs, he holds there is ſome other way to come to this knowledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides looking upon the expreſſions which are conſequent to the knowledg; whereas the way to it is before it, and that the expreſſions naked of themſelves, and left unguarded of other helps are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve and ſecure the truths they contain; the Poſitions then are both true, That the Scripture is the beſt Rule to govern our expreſſions by, and yet not ſufficient to regulate our Beleef; and the contradictions you fancy between them, proceeds not from his inconſtancy, but your inadvertence.</p>
               <p n="9">¶ 9. <hi>Of late I have read over</hi> Iraeneus, <hi>diligently endeavouring to ſee the Rule he takes for to confute the Errors he writes againſt, and cannot ſee but you are out:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52610:74"/>
One or two places indeed I have found ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to favour you, which ſince I find your Writers make uſe of, yet if I underſtand any thing he is your enemie. He ſays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in his fifth Book,</hi> cap. 4. <hi>What if the Apoſtles had not left us Scriptures, ought we not to have followed the order of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they delivered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But does not this imply, we need not uſe crutches, ſeeing we have legs; ſome Nations he ſays had no written Word, yet had the ſame Doctrine which was written: What then? As long as they have and retain the Doctrine purely, whether in writing or in their hearts, it is well, but though the Apoſtles did leave ſome Nations the Goſpel without Writing, it does not follow that they would have always retained and kept it in ſucceeding ages pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; where is there any particular Church under heaven, that hath to this day kept the doctrines of ſalvation from the Apoſtles entirely without any writing? He might challenge his Adverſaries to ſhew their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine came from the Apoſtles by Tradition, living preſently after thoſe times wherein ſome that converſed with the Apoſtles lived, and when all Churches agreed (as in</hi> Iraene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>his time) in matters of Faith, and that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52610:74"/>
unity was then a good aſſurance, they all came from one fountain; but the caſe is altred, thoſe ancient Churches afterwards were divided, and then whom muſt a man beleeve, when each ſay they have the way to heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">¶ 9. I am ſorry your opinion and mine diſagree ſo much about <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whom though I cannot profeſs to have read ſo exactly as you do, yet I dare ſay I am not miſtaken, as I think you are, in the ſence of thoſe places I have read: And firſt, the edge of thoſe two, you bring in our behalf, ſeems not at all taken off by the Anſwers you give them. For ſince in caſe no Scriptures had been left, he refers us to the order of Tradition, plainly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Tradition would have done our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that we had not, even in that caſe been left without a rule (it had been non-ſence to refer us to a rule, which would not have been a rule when tryed, and had he thought ſo, he would certainly have told us, there had been in that caſe no rule at all) and if ſo, then pray why is not Tradition as much a rule with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as without them? They may add to its force by their teſtimony, but take
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52610:75"/>
away nothing of its efficacy. For, that the truths, which the Apoſtles taught, were written, ſure makes them no whit the leſſe truths, and if it may be known what 'twas they taught (as you ſee <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> is of the opinion it may by Tradition) I hope the ſecurity is equal whether it were or were not commended to writing. This place then (which by the way is not in the fifth but third Book) makes it very evident <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held another rule beſides Scripture, that is Scripture not the onely Rule, which is your Tenet.</p>
               <p>Again, ſince ſome Nations had the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but had no Scriptures, does it not follow undeniably that there was another means beſides Scripture to preſerve the Doctrine amongſt them? and further that the Apoſtles truſted not to writing the preſervation of the Doctrine they taught them? which had they intended for a means, much more the only means of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they cannot be imagined to have omitted. I learn therfore from this place, both the efficacy of Tradition, which actually did preſerve the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine without writing, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtles, who left their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52610:75"/>
doctrine in theſe Nations not to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but Tradition, to be preſerved. But it follows not, ſay you, they would have retained their doctrine pure in ſucceeding ages, although they did ſo till <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s time. And pray why does it not follow? provided they would ſtill make uſe of the means by which they retain'd pure doctrine till that time: and what time ſhall be aſſigned in which the ſame cauſe ſhall leave off producing the ſame effect? ſince confeſſedly traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did preſerve the Doctrine till then, you ſhould prove, not barely affirm, it could do ſo no longer. But the truth is, and your own clear thoughts will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew it you, that rule was ſo far from a likelihood of betraying the truths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her, that it cannot be contrived into a poſſibility that it ſhould betray them; for ſince the Apoſtles left them the truth, as long as they retained what they received from the Apoſtles, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing elſe, which is the method of Tradition, pray what door could Error find to creep in at? 'Twas not therefore poſſible for them to make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their faith, till they had firſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52610:76"/>
thrown their rule overboard, and they would not only have preſerved their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine pure to ſucceeding Ages, by the ſame means they had preſerv'd it till then, but they could not preſerve it pure, while they retain'd the ſame means which had preſerv'd it till then.</p>
               <p>To the following queſtion I anſwer, the Church, of which by Gods mercie I am a member, has preſerved the doctrines of ſalvation entire, not without writings indeed, but without making them her Rule to preſerve them by, neither had ſhe, or could ſhe have preſerved them, had there been no other means left her then words. For what you ſay next, I refer you to the <hi>third Dialogue,</hi> to ſee, ſince 'tis the ſame thing in point of certaintie, to receive a truth immediately, through two hands, or through twentie, provided we be ſure there be no deceit in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Conveyers, all poſſibilitie of deceit removed from them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our certaintie equal with that of thoſe who lived nearer the Apoſtles times. As for the unity of the Churches in the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> 'tis true there was an unity, and ſtil is amongſt all thoſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52610:76"/>
that ſtuck to Tradition, but then, as now, ſome were divided, and by the ſame means as now, <hi>viz.</hi> by preferring their private Interpretations of Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doctrine they had been taught. This divided the <hi>Valentinians</hi> in the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> in the time of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in Saint <hi>Auſtins,</hi> in all Ages ſome, and divides you now. And the way to know whom a man muſt beleeve, when each ſay they have the way to Heaven, was then, as now, to keep faſt to what had been taught, to follow thoſe Churches that do ſo, and thoſe that build upon private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reject; ſo that the caſe is not at all altered, the method of arriving to the knowledge of ſaving truths, being the ſame anciently and now.</p>
               <p n="10">¶. 10. <hi>That</hi> Irenaeus <hi>apprehended all thoſe truths neceſsary for ſalvation, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, which ſome places for a while have had without writing, is clear by what follows, and that the Scripture is a ſufficient rule to ſalvation, and was to him and the Church in his dayes which enjoyed it: he tells us, the Apostles left the ſame in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in</hi> lib. 3. cap. 1. edit.

as concern us, truly I ſee not; for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doubts but the doctrine of Chriſt is the foundation of our faith, that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as well as preached, and this not by chance, but by particular Providence and inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, any of which poſitions when I contradict, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is againſt me: In the mean time I appeal to the very Rules of Syntax, whether he be not againſt you: and whether <hi>Scripturis fundamentum</hi> will agree, that Scripture be the foundation, which the conſtruction plainly attributes to <hi>Evangelium;</hi> that is, the doctrine or points of faith, that is, the ſenſe of the Letter, not the letter to be ſenc'd; which is the Tenet you maintain, we oppoſe.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52610:79"/>
here, that no part of either of them prompts me to ſuſpect the Father did ſo much as think of it. His buſineſſe in theſe chapters, as far as I apprehend, is, in the firſt to ſhew the abſurdity of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a fancie drawn from an obſcure Parable, to an acknowledged doctrine, and even in Scripture plain to religious Lovers of truth: and in the ſecond, to teach the impoſſibility of attaining to all knowledge in this life, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of being content to know as much as God is pleaſ'd we ſhould, and be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the reſt.

The laſt is out of the fourteenth Chapter of the third Book, which to make ſtrong againſt us, you aſſume two things, and I conceive neither true: Firſt, That he confutes them all along by Scriptures; which I do not ſee, how it would advantage you were it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for becauſe he ſaw it convenient to diſpute out of Scripture, will it therefore follow, no other way of diſputing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull or poſſible: We diſpute with you every day out of Scripture, yet hold another a ſurer, nay the onely rule; but I wonder the diligence you profeſs ſhould ſo far deceive the candour you are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of, as to offer it for true, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have obſerved the firſt Chapters of this very Book are employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52610:81"/>
them by Tradition, and that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is made uſe of, not for neceſſity (I cannot ſpeak more of the abundant effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Tradition then he does) but out of abundance, <hi>ut undique reſiſtatur illis ſi quos ex his retuſione confundentes ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſionem veritatis adducere poſſimus,</hi> as he ſays in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter of this Book, which you ſee is an expreſſion not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but charity. And if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for I have not the means to ſtudie it exactly, his whole ſecond Book is ſo fill'd with Arguments from reaſon, That Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is hardly ſo much as mentioned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſometimes by the by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you aſſume with as much injuſtice, as miſtake, that their Objection is the ſame with ours, and the Anſwer given by him to them, the ſame you give to us: Our Tenet (for objection, while we are upon the defenſive, we make none) is that Scripture is not the rule of Faith; That of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that I mean which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks to in this place, was, as you may ſee in the beginning of the thirteenth Chapter, that none but S. <hi>Paul</hi> was acquainted with the truth, as having only received it by revelation,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52610:82"/>
whereby all his Arguments in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter, from the authorities of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> S. <hi>Philip,</hi> &amp;c. had been overthrown; to ſtrengthen them, he proves in the thirteenth chapter, that not only S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but the reſt of the Diſciples alſo underſtood the Myſtery of Salvation; and in the 14 particularly S. <hi>Luke</hi> and theſe two, <hi>Viz.</hi> Scripture is not the ſole rule of Faith, S. <hi>Paul</hi> alone was acquainted with the Myſteries of Salvation, an exact ſtudier of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and impartial lover of truth, would have to be the ſame. As to the place it ſelf; this I conceive to be your Argument, S. <hi>Paul</hi> delivered all he knew to S. <hi>Luke,</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> writ all was delivered him; therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew all that was neceſſary to ſalvation, S. <hi>Luke</hi> writ all was neceſſary to ſalvation. To which I have already anſwered, that though I ſhould admit the Concluſion, little would be advanced in order to our Queſtion, ſince we deny not but all may be containd in Scripture ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, particularly, or under general heads, but that all is ſo contain'd, as is neceſſary for the ſalvation of mankind; to which effect we conceive certainty, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52610:82"/>
to that evidence requiſite, neither of which are within the compaſs of naked words, left without any guard to the violent and contrary ſtorms of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.</p>
               <p>But I conceive you do the Saint wrong, and underſtand the word <hi>all</hi> in a ſence far different from what he did; for having learnt from <hi>S. John,</hi> ſo little a Book as <hi>S. Lukes</hi> could not hold truly all, till you can prove he meant his Book for a rule of Faith, and intended to deliver in it all things neceſſary to ſalvation, I muſt beleeve 'tis no ordinary violence that can force ſuch a ſence upon it, as has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a likely, nor any ground; but ſince your own profeſſion, and large citations, ſhew both a confidence and eſteem of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> give me leave with that ſerious earneſtneſs, which the concern of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for no leſs is in Queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to preſſe your own words upon you, and deſire you to obſerve and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially weigh the Truth, while I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the proceedings of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to you, and make you judge whether of us take part with the Father, whether with his Adverſaries. The Error of the <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52610:83"/>
was built upon certain obſcure places of Scripture, or rather indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain deceitful reaſonings in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy (as your denial of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for example is, and a denial even of the B. Trinity, if you pleas'd might be) but perceiving the Rules of Chriſtianity did not allow that for a foundation of Faith, they endeavoured to ſupport the edifice by Scripture, bragging, no doubt, among their followers, it was clearly on their ſide, but being preſs'd to a Tryal, giving in evidence the obſcure places mentioned.</p>
               <p>Againſt this, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> contends that Parables, becauſe capable of many Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not to be relyed upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſince only the true ſenſe of Scripture is Scripture, that Scripture is vainly pretended, where the many ſences leave us uncertain which is the true one. Then examining the places for his ſide, and ſhewing them both in clearneſs and number to over-ballance the other, he overthrows their pretence, and preſerves the majeſty of Scripture to his party: The ſame do we to you, who, building moſt of your miſtakes in Faith, upon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52610:83"/>
miſtakes in Philoſophy, pretend plain Scripture, and when it comes to tryal, bring places capable of as many ſences, as the <hi>Valentinian</hi> parables were of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. We anſwer, as he did, that there is no relying upon ſuch places: And, examining thoſe we conceive to be of our ſide, and comparing them with yours, both in clearneſs and number, conclude your ſences not true, and Scripture not only not for you, but againſt you. Yet all this while neither he, nor we think Scripture, for this diſputing out of it, the only rule of Faith, whether it be, or no, being not in theſe caſes, our queſtion. But ſince as the <hi>Valentinians</hi> did then, you will now undertake to prove Scripture is againſt us, and as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> then, ſo we now acknowledge nothing is to be held againſt Scripture, we do, as he did, ſhew you cannot make good your undertaking.</p>
               <p>Next, The <hi>Valentinians,</hi> by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of their neerneſs to the Primitive times better acquainted with the grounds of faith then you, would have juſtified their Interpretations by Tradition: an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proof what it was which thoſe firſt Ages held the Interpreter of Scripture,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52610:84"/>
and that ſo undeniably, that even He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks pretended to it. What ſays <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> to this? Does he anſwer as you do, that Tradition is not to be regarded, but the cauſe to be decided by Scripture, and that the only Rule? by no means: but carefully and diligently proves Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be againſt them: Which he alſo declares to be, not what they pretended, by abuſe of thoſe words, <hi>Sapientiam lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur inter perfectos,</hi> whiſpering cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conveyances of one to another (ſuch as the <hi>Cabala</hi> you object to us) but the open, plain profeſſion of thoſe Churches to whom the Apoſtles left their doctrine and its practice, and among which, he conceives that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſufficient.</p>
               <p>This publike Teſtimony, as he, ſo we lay claim to, and profeſs with him, would be ſufficient, even though there were no Scriptures at all; which nevertheleſs ſince Gods infinite goodneſs has provided for us, we do not underſtand the force of the former impaired by the addition of a new force. But, that belonging to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother queſtion, give me leave to end the preſent one with this confidence,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52610:84"/>
that you cannot but ſee we follow the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſteps, and you thoſe who follow the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and that it appears by what hath been ſaid, your Minor neither is, nor, ſince you have failed, in likelihood ever will be proved.</p>

                  <p>BEing now arrived at the ſecond Part of your Diſcourſe, I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the firſt Paraph neceſſary to be taken notice of but the laſt words, <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>'tis unreaſonable to pretend to prove our Religion infallible,</hi> and yet <hi>bring no poſitive Arguments,</hi> &amp;c. In the firſt Branch of which ſaying you are not much amiſs; nothing being more unreaſonable, then that a Church, which confeſſedly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52610:86"/>
was once the true one, ſhould be put to prove ſhe is now no falſe one, when all the Maximes of common ſence, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature, ſuppoſe her innocence, till the contrary be, not by ſurmiſes and probabilities, but plainly and undeniably proved. Whoever therefore ſays ſhe has fail'd, ought to prove it, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhe ſhould prove the impoſſibility of the contrary. 'Tis true, the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendence of charity has prevailed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo unreaſonable a Task here, but not without proteſting againſt the neceſſity of doing it, as you ſee in the ſecond Paraph of this <hi>Dialogue.</hi> But the ſecond is ſo injurious, that, had all men been of your temper, perhaps it would have been well done to have ſtood wholly upon that ſure guard you reproach Mr <hi>White</hi> withal, and which the advantage of his cauſe gives him, and never medled with poſitive Arguments, which though unanſwered, and for ought I can imagin, unanſwerable, ſince I do not beleeve any man can ſay more then you have done, you would yet deny to be ſo much as Arguments.</p>
                  <p>That perſwaſion of yours too, which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52610:86"/>

                  <p n="2">¶ 2. <hi>In his firſt Encounter he gives a Compendium of the Argument,</hi> page 8. <hi>Her doctrine is received from Chriſt and ſtill handed along to the preſent time: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſay, for example, in the eighth Age an Error crept in: Hee'l reply, it entred not in, becauſe that Age held nothing was to be admitted as of Faith, except that was delivered to it by the former, therefore ſeeing that was then firſt beleeved, it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the former, therefore not received. I anſwer, no new opinion, when firſt it creeps up, is entertaind by any as a new thing which was not before, but as forgotten, or not diſcern'd, or loſt before; do you think the</hi> Arians <hi>lookt upon their Doctrine as new, which was never beleeved before, or that was contrary to what the Apoſtles taught? If they did, they would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> caſt off all Chriſtianity, and held nothing with the Orthodox.</hi> Mr White <hi>brings in our Objection, The Church did not ſtand upon that ſame traditional ground formerly, as</hi> Rome <hi>now. He replys,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52610:87"/>
If this principle did not always govern the Church, it was introduced in ſome Age, the eighth for example, either (ſays he againſt this) the Church had aſſurance in that eighth Age, all ſhe held was deſcended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally, as we ſpeak, from the Apoſtles, or not; if ſhe had, then queſtionleſs ſhe held her Doctrine upon that Maxime: If not, then ſhe wilfully belied, and damned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily taking up this new,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is this the Demonſtration?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">¶ 2. Your ſtating, and oppoſing Mr <hi>Whites</hi> Argument, making me ſuſpect you did not yet perfectly comprehend it; I beg leave to put you in mind, there are two things he endeavours to prove. 1. That if the Church always rely'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maxime of immediate delivery, ſhe could admit no error into her Faith: 2. That ſhe did always rely upon that Maxime. The firſt he proves thus, if an Error came in, it came in at ſome time, let that time be the eighth Age, and if the Church then admitted nothing but what ſhe had received, and this ſhe had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (for you put it then firſt to come in) ſhe did not admit it then, nor by the ſame evidence could admit any error in any age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:52610:87"/>
To the ſecond we ſhall ſpeak in the fourth Paraph; to this you anſwer, no new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is entertain'd, as a new thing which was not before, but as forgotten, or not diſcern'd, or loſt before: An Anſwer which I dare not profeſs a perfect compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of, not ſeeing to which of the premiſes 'tis directly oppos'd by a plain grant, denial, or diſtinction, one of which ought always to keep company with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very anſwer: but conceive the force of the Argument is not any thing empair'd by it; for let it be entertain'd as loſt, as forgotten, or how you will, ſo it were not immediatly delivered, either the Rule muſt be broken, or it could not be entertain'd. And this I think evident, even by your very termes: for if it were entertain'd as forgotten, then 'twas entertain'd as a thing which ſome former Age forgot to deliver, then ſome former Age did not deliver it, then, if nothing were entertain'd but what was delivered, pray how could this find entertainment?</p>
                  <p>To your queſtion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> I anſwer 'tis very likely the Ringleaders among them perſwaded their followers ſuch fine
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52610:88"/>
things as you ſay, That their doctrine was not new, &amp;c. but nothing could blinde them ſo far as not to ſee, 'twas not taught them by their immediate forefathers. And though conceit of <hi>Arius</hi>'s vertue and learning prevail'd with the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as ambition and intereſt with the more ſubtle, not to value and to deſert this Rule, yet 'twas impoſſible they ſhould be ignorant that they did deſert it. They would then have caſt off all Chriſtianity, ſay you, and truly the experience of my own Countrey makes me believe they would, had they continued unoppoſed long enough to have purſued their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whether it would have led them. But nature endures not an immediate paſſage from one extreme to another; a conſideration, which being touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I now ſay no more to, and paſſe to your next difficultie, which, by your acknowledging is brought in by Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> objection, I perceive, is levelled againſt the ſecond not the firſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: our buſineſſe now therefore is to examine, whether the Church has always adhered to this maxime, there being no diſpute, but that (if ſhe hath) ſhe could
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52610:88"/>
not admit of any Error in her Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">¶ 3. <hi>This I am ſure of, that either I do underſtand nothing of it, or there's no force in it: By aſſurance I ſuppoſe he means not abſolute certainty; if he do, the ſecond horn of the Dilemma upon which we fall, does us no hurt; I conceive he means</hi> thought; <hi>if the eighth Age thought all ſhe held was deſcended lineally from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, then ſhe held her Doctrine upon that Maxim: But ſhe thought all ſhe held was deſcended lineally from the Apoſtles (is not that the Minor to be ſupplied, if we turn the firſt part into a Catagorical Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm) therefore ſhe held her Doctrine upon that Maxim. This I think is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, for I do not clearly diſcern his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuppoſe only I grant the Concluſion; me thinks he does not conclude what he was to prove, which ſhould be this, therefore that Age was not the firſt that held her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon that Maxim. But to the other part of the Dilemma more fully.</hi>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52610:89"/>
denying but that ſhe either had, or had not. In the firſt Caſe his Diſcourſe runs thus: ſhe had aſſurance in the eighth Age, before ſhe took up the Maxime ſaid to be new, therefore ſhe had the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, by which ſhe had aſſurance, before; this Maxime could be no other then <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> nothing elſe being able to give her aſſurance, therefore ſhe had the Maxime of <hi>Tradition</hi> before, therefore that Age was not the firſt ſhe took it up in: which is what you deſire ſhould be the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">¶ 4. <hi>If not (ſays he) then ſhe wilfully belied her ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I wholly deny this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs will follow; thus the</hi> 8th <hi>Age enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that principle firſt of all, ſuppoſe ſhe might think it true, when it was not, and ſo no wilfulneſs; might not the Church think all ſhe held deſcended to her through the interjacent Ages by the Bible which is handed ſtill to her, and yet not think all ſhe received deſcended lineally in your ſence? I pray Sir, make my dull capacitie ſee this abſurdity, which I profeſs I cannot; I think if your Argument prove any thing, it proves againſt all Errors in general any where, that they could not have come into
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52610:89"/>
the world, and then I wiſh exceedingly your Argument were true. The Heretick held no Error, becauſe he held nothing was to be embraced but truth; Is not this the very ſame Argument?</hi> Mr White <hi>ſays ſome of yours maintain Tenets in other termes, that are condemned; might I not prove the contrary by his own Argument; the Error could not enter into them, becauſe they held nothing was to be entertaind, as of Faith, except what was delivered to them by the former; this is the very Argument: To ſay the caſe is not the ſame in reſpect of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality is not to the purpoſe; for there is no univerſality mentioned in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſtreſs is not yet put in that; If the argument be true in one, I ſee not why it ſhould not be in another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">¶ 4. But you take the ſecond Part, in which caſe he preſſes you deny, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admittable wilfulneſs: Let us ſee; The Suppoſition puts the Church not aſſured whether her Doctrine were lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, or no; The Maxime makes her oblige her Poſterity, under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation too, to beleeve it was ſo deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is to beleeve what ſhe knew not to be true, that is, what for ought ſhe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52610:90"/>
knew was falſe, &amp; yet you diſcover no wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Pray can reaſon juſtifie a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to accept that for true, which the Commander knows may be falſe, and for ought he knows is ſo? and is there any other principle of action, beſides reaſon, but will? I but ſhe might think her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple true, when it was not; but what if no greater wilfulneſs can be imagined then to think ſo? for you muſt mean it true, either in reſpect it had conveied the true faith to her, or would convey the true Faith to her poſterity. The firſt is Nonſence, for that Age being ſuppoſed the firſt in which ſhe took up the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the faith ſhe had muſt of neceſſity have been conveid to her by ſome other. The ſecond is as bad or worſe, for if that principle be the Teſt of true Faith, her own, not being received by it, muſt needs be thought not to be true, &amp; that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the Faith ſhe commended to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be conveid, could even wilfulneſs make her think that principle would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a true Faith to her poſterity, which had received a falſe one to convey?</p>
                  <p>But ſhe might, ſay you, think her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine true, as taught by the Bible, which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52610:90"/>
Bible was handed down to her, though her Doctrine were not: If ſhe did but think ſo, ſhe did not know it to be true; therefore it was not certain to her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but probable; therefore to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it as true and certain, which to her was not ſo, was to do what ſhe had no ground for, that is to act wilfully.</p>
                  <p>Again, if ſhe thought her ſelf to have received the true faith from the Bible, ſhe muſt needs think the Bible a means to convey the true faith to her, that is a true rule, then to deſert that which ſhe thought a true one, and impoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the onely true one, beſides which, ſhe thought, even when ſhe impos'd the ſecond, the firſt alſo to be true, pray what name can it own but <hi>wilfulneſs?</hi> Thus which way ſoever we turn, nothing appears but impoſſibility; which alſo a little reflected on, would be diſcovered much greater, and far deeper plunged into contradiction: For were it poſſible a Council, for example, ſhould be ſo maliciouſly wilfull, as to conſent to the damnation of all poſterity; mankind has rooted in it a greater deſire of its own good, then to be ſo cheated into
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52610:91"/>
everlaſting miſery, eſpecially ſo openly that it could not be ignorant of the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. But neither is it proper for me to dilate that am an Anſwerer, neither is it neceſſary to one that ſees day ſo ſoon as you do.</p>
                  <p>To go on then, you think the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves againſt all Errors, if any thing, but why you think ſo, you do not ſay, and indeed I cannot gueſs: One only ſuppoſition ſeems able to give the fancie any colour, <hi>Viz.</hi> That our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe neceſſary to Salvation, taught alſo all manner of other truths whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in all Arts and Sciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, being equally recommended to <hi>Tradition,</hi> flow down in the ſame great channel to us; but this me thinks is too wild a fancie to ſuſpect you of. Next, you parallel our Argument with one you frame in behalf of an Heretick in this manner: He holds nothing is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced but truth, therefore what he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces is truth; put your Heretick to have a right method of arriving at truth, and faithfully to purſue it, and there is no doubt but your Concluſion is ſtrong, and ſo ſtrong that it quite overthrows
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52610:91"/>
the Suppoſition, for he cannot in that caſe be an Heretick; but that he has any ſuch method, or makes any uſe of it, we muſt ſeek elſewhere then in your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which out of this that the thing ſhould be done, concludes it is done. By the ſincerity you profeſs, and ow to the concern of eternity, do we argue in that manner? Do not we prove both that our method cannot fail us, and that we never failed to make uſe of our method? The firſt under penalty of this evident contradiction, that the ſame thing muſt be beleeved before, and not before the ſame time; the ſecond by the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that mankind ſhould conſpire noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and unconcealably to cheat their poſterity into everlaſting damnation. And is this to ſay the Concluſion over in the Antecedent, and then infer it in the Conſequent: Beſeech you, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thoſe ſallies of wit, to things leſſe dangerous to be plaid upon then ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you object Mr <hi>Whites</hi> ſaying that ſeveral condemn'd Tenets are maintain'd in other terms by ſome Divines, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that theſe Divines, holding nothing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52610:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as of Faith but what was delivered by the former age, would have no Error. And that is true, meaning Errors in Faith, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines proceed upon other Rules when they err, and their Errors concern no Faith but Divinity. It may indeed ſo happen, that theſe Errors in Divinity do alſo contradict ſome point of Faith; but that the equivocation of terms hinders them from ſeeing, in which caſe the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is erroneous, and againſt Faith, the beleef of the maintainer, who ſees not ſo much, very good and unblameable. Now, if I underſtand the Poſition right, 'tis no more then this, that ſome Divines underſtand not the force of terms uſed by themſelves, which rigorouſly ſcanned may happen to contain an error unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him who uſes them, but dives not ſo far into them. Remember then, if you pleaſe, the caſe is of Divines, that is of perſons working according to the rules of ſcience, not of faithful proceeding upon grounds of Faith, after which I hope you will not infer an Error in the rule of Faith,, becauſe there be errors in things concluded by other Principles.</p>
                  <p n="5">¶ 5. <hi>And truly if I have eyes,</hi> Mr Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52610:92"/>
                     <hi>does not more then ſhew a kinde of poſſibilitie, that all points of faith could have been handed down, the firſt delivered them to the ſecond Age, the third heard them of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the fourth of the third, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">¶. 5. When you writ this Paragraph, your thoughts certainly were ſo fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place in which your objection is brought in, that the next leaves, almoſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52610:93"/>
the next lines, eſcape their obſervance. The leaſt advance would have ſuggeſted to them, that not only a poſſibility of preſerving truth, but a plain actual inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility is aim'd at. Not but that a poſſibility is enough, ſuch a poſſibility I mean, or power, as we ſpeak of, that is, ſuch as has the nature of a proper cauſe to its effect, that is, which ſhould have done the effect. Since if our Rule be proper to convey the truth to us, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can rationally affirm it has not done, what 'tis granted, 'twas of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apt to do without evidencing what he ſays. Let thoſe therefore, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of errors, refuſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with us, take it to heart, and either plainly evince him, or tremble at the horrour of living in a continued and obſtinate ſchiſme.

                  <p>To gueſs at what the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52610:93"/>
aims, which puts a poſſibility of truth, and a poſſibility of error, this indeed the more probable, but no more then probable, I am quite at a loſſe. Would you have no certaintie in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, no Religion at all in the world? For with what ſteadineſs can I act in order towards Heaven, if my thoughts be perpetually checkt with this doubt, for example, that perhaps there is no Heaven at all; and if I be uncertain of it, is it poſſible to ſhake off the doubt? Till I comprehend your deſign therfore, I ſhall only deſire you to reflect, that if the poſſibility of error be only the more probable, then 'tis but probable, then the contrary, though leſs, is yet probable too; then it may be there are no errors in the Church you refuſe communion with. Therefore, ſince to divide, is as much as lies in the divider, to deſtroy the Church, and to deſtroy the Church is to take away all hopes of ſalvation, (for ſince we cannot know the way to Heaven of our ſelves, if we loſe our miſtreſs that ſhould teach it us, there can remain no ground of hope,) and this from all mankind, conſider, if you pleaſe what
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52610:94"/>
'tis to continue a ſeparation, and at the ſame time acknowledge, that perhaps there are no errors, that is, no ground why you ſhould do ſo. But we will beleeve no errors till we ſee them; no indeed, we will not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict nature ſo much, which ſuppoſes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man innocent till he be proved guilty.</p>
                  <p>In return to your civility of not intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out of my Religion, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you not to be out of it neither, and to remember, that your ſoul being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd with mine, 'tis your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as well as mine, not to beleeve any errors, where you ſee there may be none, till you ſee they are there, and that not probably, but with undeniable evidence, when, as you will be able to ſhew them, I promiſe you, I will be ready to deſert them.</p>
                  <p n="6">¶. 6. <hi>But Mr.</hi> White <hi>would fain prove more from the natural inclination of truth and happineſs: this I think if it prove any thing, proves man will needs be a groping after ſome Religion or other, but that it ſhould be after the true, or make him preſerve the true Religion, (I ſhall give Account why I will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52610:94"/>
not aſſent unto) without corruption, I ſee not, or why it ſhould not prove as well that every particular man, in whom there is ſuch an inclination, ſhould preſerve the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Reaſon why that inclination ſpoken of doth no way prove the Point, is from the fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>if there were no ſuch thing as the corruption of mans nature, Mr</hi> Whites <hi>Reaſon would have more likelihood in it, and hereby appears the weakneſs of your cauſe, in that you are fain (the acuteſt of you) to have recourſe to ſuch Bulruſhes to make weapons of, as the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man ready to uphold (what, the pure Oracles of God?) No, the contrary rather. The natural man or man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is blinded, and ſees not the things of God, they are contrary to him, rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Superſtition then the true Worſhip of God, is naturally more ſteady in Idolatry then the pure ſervice of God; will you not take my word for this? Read</hi> Jer. 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>ſeee if there be ſuch a thing; Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods; but my people have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their glory for that which doth not profit.</hi>

                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52610:95"/>¶ 6. I think you miſtake Mr <hi>Whites</hi> Argument here: And firſt whereas you put a natural inclination to truth and happineſs; His words are, that hopes and fears in the will, ignorance and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of another mans knowledge in the underſtanding, are the Parents of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And I preſume you mean the ſame thing, but ſpeak contractedly. Now I conceive 'tis not from this barely, he proves the preſervation of true Religion, as you ſeem to ſuppoſe, but from hence, that man being not to be wrought upon but by reaſon, authority, or power, none of the three can be imagined to have place, where the Religion is ſuppoſed once true, and largely diſperſed: So that you ſeem to take a part of the Argument for the whole.</p>
                  <p>As for the difficulty from the corrupti- of nature in man, 'tis that corruption which makes him deceivable by the ways mentioned for were his nature entirely ſound, neither power nor authority could be imagined forcible enough to prevail with him againſt his own good, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot be ſuppoſed oppoſite to truth. So that were there no corruptions, there
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52610:95"/>
would be neither neceſſity of nor place for the Argument, which contends, That ſince there are but three ways, even in this ſtate of miſery, to work upon a man, and that none of them can be effectual in our caſe, the divine goodneſs ha-provided even againſt the defects of nas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, and placed the ſecurity of our faith, beyond the reach of its corruptions; for however vice may by as a man in opinion by hindring the faithful working of his Reaſons it, withal its malice, cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from uſing his eyes and ears in plain matters of fact, which is all our Rule of Faith requires; the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> then makes not the Argument weak, but neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps it may contribute to your ſatisfaction to obſerve, that nature is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of man in different ſignifications; for ſometimes by that word is meant Reaſon, ſometimes that frame of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Inſtruments which concur to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Animal: Now when you hear of the bad Inclinations of Nature, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, 'tis to be underſtood of the diſorder occaſioned principally in the body by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52610:96"/>
union of it with the ſoul, drawing her into evils, which are therefore ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are againſt nature, it being unpoſſible that ſhould be ill, which to nature is conformable: Man is therefore truly drawn againſt his nature, even when he follows thoſe which you call his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclinations to ſin; for ſince he is <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal rationale,</hi> if Reaſon be not his nature, he is no more a man. Now the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves that natural diſorders, taking nature in the ſecond ſence, have not the power to prevail upon his nature, taken in the firſt ſence, either to loſe all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or change the true one in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances accompanying our caſe: For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural to man, that his words ſhould flow from his thoughts, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to them, when a lie is told, that is, words are brought forth diſ-formable to the thoughts of the ſpeaker, 'tis plain that nature is croſſed, and deſign works, that is artifice, that is not nature. And ſo we ſee that thoſe, who are not in a condition to uſe deſign, as fools and drunken men, always tell truth. Further, thoſe who lie, deſign, or aim at, ſome end attainable by lying, thus force their nature, unleſſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52610:96"/>
the deſign be only mirth, riſing from the odneſs of the lie, muſt either hope to cloath it with an appearance of truth, and conceal it from being known to be what it is, or deſpair of compaſſing their deſign, nothing being more evident, then that no man wil be perſwaded by a known untruth.</p>
                  <p>Put then the Tenets of Religion to be univerſally diſperſed, and viſible in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and the people ſtrongly poſſeſſed of the truth of them, is it not undeniable that who would go about to perſwade them, either that the former Tenets were not held and practiſed, or that ſome <hi>new</hi> invention was formerly held and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, muſt be known by every body, to tell an open manifeſt lie, that is can have no hopes of concealing it, nor conſequently of prevailing with it, or compaſſing any deſign by it, that is, if he have wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee the impoſſibility, ſuch a lier muſt act without a motive (for none acts for a thing held clearly impoſſible) and ſo the action be directly carried out of the ſphere of whole rational nature which is obliged to act for ſome end or motive good or bad. You ſee then, that in both caſes rational nature, taking original ſin,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52610:97"/>
and the corruptions flowing from it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bargain, is deſtroyed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by ſuch an action, even of one ſingle man, to which if we add the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, the millions that muſt conſpire to this unnatural lie, ſince otherwiſe their authority can never over-bear the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize of thoſe who will adhere to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and known truth, the impoſſibility ſwels to a proportion ſo monſtrous, that it ſeems beyond the power even of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick it ſelf to comprehend it. And ſo much, though but little in reſpect of the latitude of the ſubject, and ſtrange advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages our rule of Faith bears with it, for mans inclination to truth, that is, as he has an underſtanding power in him.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee what follows from his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to happineſs, which is ſo the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his will that it cannot act without an aim at ſome good, either reall or apparent. Put men ſtrongly to conceit their beatitude, or eternal well-being, and that it depends wholly upon the Tenets which make up their Religion, is it not evident, this conceit ſtill remaining, which is our caſe, that there cannot be imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any greater hopes or fears, (that is,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52610:97"/>
greater motives to the will) then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeved enjoyment of heaven, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in Hell, and this for all eternity? which being ſo, 'tis as certainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that a multitude of men, thus affected, ſhall not be byaſſed to prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from ſo concerning truths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate ſo prejudicial falſhoods, as they look upon thoſe to be which contradict their Religion, as it is that a ſtraw can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weigh down a thouſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>Now put the Religion to be true, to be univerſally diſperſed, and this the Teſt of it, to admit nothing into it, but upon the account of inheritance from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Fathers, as from the firſt deliverer, and this ſo, as that it be all one to be not inherited, and to be not Religion (which three things though the preſent buſineſs do not require they ſhould be urged, are yet manifeſt in our caſe, the two laſt being viſible, almoſt to blindneſs, and the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable to Chriſtianity, ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but that the Religion which Chriſt delivered was true) and you may if you pleaſe perceive that the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is ſo far from neceſſarily occaſioning a fall from true Religion,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52610:98"/>
that mankind, once poſſeſt of the truth, and this method to preſerve it, muſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall from its nature, and degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beaſt, or ſomthing worſe, if it be not as ſteady in the pure ſervice of God, and preſervation of the truth, as of it ſelf; the props which uphold the former being full as ſtrong, if not more then thoſe which ſuſtain the later.</p>
                  <p n="7">¶. 7. <hi>The Inclination you ſpeak of to underprop your tottering infallibility, is very ſteady to uphold corruptions, and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as we accuſe you of, not ſo the pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. Again, I pray tell me, ſince you have only proved, or rather ſhewn a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of your Doctrines ſucceſsion, Is it not more poſsible to deviate from the right line then to keep cloſe to it? This probability is ſtronger againſt you then any (I cannot ſee they are any more then probabilities) you bring for your ſelves, that there could be no error univerſally ſpread over your Church: Shall I give you an inſtance to prove the poſsibility. The Jews Church, when their Forefathers were brought out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>had not the whole Nation every man of them ſufficient Inſtruction in and confirmation of the true worſhip of God, ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52610:98"/>
many wonders and ſignes as they had, yet did they not corrupt the worſhip? I hope</hi> 40 <hi>yeers is ſufficient</hi> (Mr White <hi>thought three yeers enough for the Apoſtles to be in one place) to teach the ways of God, and all thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles they had to confirm them after they were ſetled in the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>how could they loſe any points of Doctrine recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or their Traditions be corrupted, if your Arguments hold: Was it not poſſible (ſeeing it has been) they ſhould afterward again, bring in their Traditions for Truths, by which they made void the Law of God, as our Saviour ſpeaks, and thoſe Traditions (as</hi> Mr. White <hi>p.</hi> 124.) <hi>went among the Jews for currant ſound Law, and afterward continued; ask them in one of thoſe after Ages, whether it came from</hi> Moſes, <hi>(ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of thoſe falſe Traditions) he may anſwer (ſays</hi> Mr White <hi>p.</hi> 126.) <hi>he received it from their Predeceſſors, but they can yeeld no account why any Age may not have chang'd that, but why may not the Jew ask in what age (as you do us) or year their Doctrine was corrupted; but (ſays</hi> Mr. White) <hi>If I aſſign an age or yeer, can they acquit themſelves in point of proof? (and ſo I ſay of you) clearly they cannot: for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52610:99"/>
ſince there was no Regiſter, nor viſible effects of this Doctrine; and ſo unleſs you can ſhew a Register or effects for every age and yeer, you cannot prove there have been no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among you, and ſo all your infallibility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon uncertainty; what if there be not Hiſtories and Records of all paſſages of the Church (as likely there are not) how can I be ſure there have been no ſuch changes as are poſsible? and where now is your certain proof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">¶. 7. The nature of man then, being reaſon, ſee not why you ſhould ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, he is naturally more ſteady in idolatry then the pure ſervice of God, unleſs you will make the diſorder of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more his nature then reaſon it ſelf. What follows is an odd perſeverance of yours, when by taking ſo much pains to ſhew he has not demonſtrated, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge he pretends to have done ſo. Your queſtion, whether it be not more poſſible to deviate from, then to keep cloſe to the right line? will find an anſwer in this reflexion, that if a thing be made to keep us in a right line, and to guide mankinde ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by it, that the line cannot be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from, without a deviation from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52610:99"/>
(and this I have ſhewn to be our caſe) 'twill be harder to deviate from, then to keep in it: as it is very difficult to force a falling Port-cullis into a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line, which by the nature of its weight, and directions of Art is determined to a ſtreight one.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of this Paragraph, and the whole following one preſſes the failing of the Iews, an example againſt which there lie innumerable exceptions: for firſt, they were a particular Nation, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be wrought upon by hopes and feare, when any of their Princes went about to make his own wickedneſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; from which ſpring moſt of their failings were derived. Again, there wanted in their breaſts that great fire of Pentecoſt, which together with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, planted in their hearts that received it, an unſpeakable eſteem of it, and a certain perſwaſion that all things, even life it ſelf were to be neglected for it, the advantage of future goods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely overvaluing all poſſible evils in this world. Whereas, as far as I can perceive, the conceit, which the Jewes had of the next world, was very weak
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52610:100"/>
and ſlothful, being led, even to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, by hopes of temporal goods promiſed to the obſervers, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Land of Promiſe being generally apprehended but feebly.</p>
                  <p>But, what moſt imports, you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and I think can ſay nothing to prove <hi>Tradition</hi> was their rule. Their Law was delivered immediatly to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him left in writing, whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation was reſerved to the High Prieſt, what has this proceeding to do with <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi> Or would you have it preſerve them from failing, who neither made uſe of it, nor had it to make uſe of? if <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> were not their rule, which that it was I do not ſee how it can be aſſerted, pray what does their failing concern us? If not that, but the written Word was their Rule, which I do not ſee how it can be deny'd, pray what hinders your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to be concluſive againſt your ſelf, and their failing an evidence, that the written Word is no preſervative againſt Errors? This you would do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon: Mean while your Argument againſt the ſecurity we pretend to by <hi>Tradition</hi> ſtands thus; the <hi>Jews</hi> had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52610:100"/>
who followed it not, therefore we, who do, cannot be without them: A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which as I ſhould never have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from you, ſo I know not whether your ſecond thoughts will think fit to own.</p>
                  <p>But to deſcend to particulars: <hi>Had not the whole Nation of the Jews every man ſufficient inſtruction in, and confirmation of the true Worſhip of God, yet did they not corrupt the Worſhip?</hi> How far the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jews was derived to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, I am not able to anſwer, and I doubt you do but gueſs. This I ſee that thoſe things which were commended to the practice of the multitude, as their <hi>Feaſts, Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. remained entire among all their failings, though they were but a particular Nation, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that inward fire of charity infuſed by the Holy Ghoſt, together with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into the hearts of the firſt beleevers. And you ſpeak of the corruption of their Traditions, that is, private Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Law, ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood &amp; practis'd by the multitude, that being delivered with the ſeal of ſecrecie, they were not ſo much as known to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:52610:101"/>To anſwer your Argument then, what do you mean by <hi>ſufficient inſtruction?</hi> that particular men were inſtructed by the Law ſufficiently to go to Heaven, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive true: but that the inſtruction of particular men was ſufficient to preſerve the Law from being corrupted, I cannot grant; ſince I think there is not, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation, force enough to defend it ſelf from the numerous, and violent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, which the corruption of nature, you juſt now inſiſted on, will be ſure to make upon it.

And becauſe theſe made void the Law of God, ſhall therefore the thoughts and actions of an univerſality of people, in which there can be no juggle, nothing concealed, and which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all common with the former, undergo the ſame condemnation.</p>
                  <p>After this you retort <hi>Mr Whites</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Jew</hi> upon himſelf, and urge that unleſs we can ſhew a regiſter, and viſible effects for every age and year, we cannot prove there has been no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption among us. If this will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you, 'twill not be very difficult to give you ſatisfaction; for I beſeech you are not the actions of mankind viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the perſwaſion from whence they flow? if you find people going to <hi>Maſs,</hi> adoring the <hi>holy Sacrifice,</hi> aſſiſting at <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> reverencing <hi>Images,</hi> &amp;c. will you doubt of their faith concerning theſe particulars? Behold then the viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Religion, which if you aſſign any Age in which they were introduced, we thus acquit our ſelves, without the help of Hiſtory or Records in point of proof. It being much more impoſſible things
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52610:102"/>
of that notorious publikeneſs could be introduced without notice being taken that they were ſo, then for a Tumbler to ſhew tricks from <hi>Pauls</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and no body regard him, the age you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign could not but know they were then brought in: But the principle of that Age being to receive nothing but what was delivered by her Forefathers, ſhe could not admit of theſe things, which 'tis manifeſt ſhe was conſcious were then firſt begun, and by the ſame evidence, they could be begun in no Age, but that of their author, Chriſt, by whom, ſince they are now received, 'tis very clear they were delivered.</p>
                  <p>See now how this will fit the <hi>Jew,</hi> whoſe Traditions, there being no ſuch principle to keep them out, may, for ought he can tell, be brought in in any Age, and whom in ſo ſuſpicious and fallacious a ſecrecie, as accompanied them, 'tis impoſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſatisfie, that the Maſters he relies upon, either have not deceived him, or are not deceived themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="8">¶ 8. <hi>Thoſe Traditions, which went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewiſh people for ſound Law, (as</hi> Mr White <hi>p.</hi> 124.) <hi>which the Phariſees
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52610:102"/>
taught them, have continued ſince with them, in their ſeveral Countries where they have been ſcattered; although they have no Sanhedrims, ſeeing they agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them, May they not prove, with your Argument, ſuch Traditions came from</hi> Moſes, <hi>they have been handed ſtill to them from father to ſon, and that in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that they could not meet together to compoſe this forgerie: ſo that it is no ſuch impoſsible thing, as to leap over</hi> Pauls <hi>ſteeple (though</hi> Mr White <hi>&amp;c.) as for your falſe Traditions to have firſt ſpread themſelves very largely and by degrees, and then being ſo ſpread to continue long, and yet to be falſe, there's example of its poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Jews, and likewiſe in the Turks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="8">¶ 8. Here you argue in this manner: The Jews now, in the time of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion into ſeveral Countries, agree in thoſe falſe Traditions, which had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been taught them by the Phariſees, and which paſſed among them for ſound Law, therefore our diſcourſe proves they came from <hi>Moſes.</hi> Of which argument I doubt your Antecedent has more of confidence then ground: for where, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52610:103"/>
how does this agreement of the ſcattered Jews to theſe Traditions appear? By as much as I can learn, from the ſmall commerce I have had my ſelf, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I could get from others, they are far enough from an uniformity in their opinions. Neither do I know their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is general in any thing, but what the natural force, there is in Tradition, preſerves in them, as the times and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of celebrating their Feaſts, their circumciſion, the ornaments for their Synagogues and whatever elſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of perpetual practice ſuffers them not to diſagree in. Now this ſeems ſo far from weakning, that it ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the force of <hi>Tradition,</hi> which if it have, even unawares, ſuch an effect upon them, I do not ſee why it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied its efficacy upon us.</p>
                  <p>You may perhaps think theſe things are preſerved by writing: But I conceive it follows not, that if a thing be written, it does not owe its preſervation to <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that both theſe things, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and all, have been preſerved by it. Nay, I beleeve that when you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the buſineſs well, you will find
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52610:103"/>
little agreement in any thing, whether written, or not, that does not proceed from this method. Though, were your Antecedent admitted, I do not ſee how it juſtifies your conſequence. For though ſuch an agreement may argue the diſſent of what they agree in from the time of their diſperſion, it will not reach one jot farther, nor afford any ſhew of reaſon, why ſome one of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial Ages, betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and the diſperſion, may not have begun and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed the doctrine pretended to deſcend from <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                  <p n="9">¶ 9, 10, 11. The Diſcourſe in your following Paragraphs is ſtrong, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your ſelf, and though by miſtake of our Tenets, not concluding againſt us, yet full of excellently deduced truth. And firſt to defend <hi>Mr White,</hi> who only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the addition of Truths, why do you ſo confidently call that an evident way how Error might enter, and ſpread it ſelf in the Church? Is Truth and Error all one? or does it follow that becauſe men are content to admit of what they ſee to be true, they will not check at what they either ſee is falſe, or do not ſee is true? Will it ever follow out of Mr <hi>Whites</hi> Poſition, that there is no harm in adding of truths, that the miſcheif of adding er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors cannot be avoided?</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe I conceive the miſtake your whole Diſcourſe runs upon, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a wrong apprehenſion of the infallibility of Councils, I find it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve that, though ſome of our Doctors ſpeak of Councils ſo indiſtinctly, that they beget ſuch an opinion of their infallibility and authority, as I perceive
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52610:106"/>
you fancie, yet the beſt Divines, with whom Mr <hi>White</hi> agrees, do not allow any power in the Church of making new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, that is, of making that to be faith to day, which was not faith ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and the day before, and always, which it could not be, without being taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: whence 'tis evidently conſequent, that if they cannot make any new thing to be faith, neither can they oblige any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and beleeve it, as faith. Their power therefore of impoſing Faith upon us (whatever fancies the confuſion of ſome Diſcourſes hath raiſed) extends no farther then to ſuch things as both were, and were known to be faith before their Impoſition: And ſure no danger can be ſuſpected from an Authority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that which the whole world ſees whether they have authority to do or no. And ſo much for faith.</p>
                  <p>As for truths collected from Premiſes; Firſt, it appears they have no power to introduce them into the Catalogue of faith; I except ſuch as appear plainly at firſt ſight, and need no skill at all to their deduction, which, though in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52610:106"/>
they be not properly faith, are yet in a moral eſtimation accounted the ſame, and ſo by the world (which in ſuch plain things cannot be deceived) are indifferently beleeved. Secondly, A Council, being an Aſſembly of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt men in the Church, cannot be denied to ſee into conſequences far enough to know whether they be truly deduced or no; ſo that if they ingage for the truth, of any one, as it cannot be exalted into faith, ſo neither can it be imagined falls without ſome prejudice croſſing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of nature, which moves us to beleeve every one in his trade. Neither do I think, whatever you ſay of your hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Mathematicians, in which ſcience being your ſelf a Maſter, to truſt is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but that if half a hundred Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould agree ſuch a peice of timber would fit ſuch a houſe, or as many Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ſuch a peece of ground contained ſo many Acres, your heart could not chuſe but think it true, what ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the ſtrength of your wit might make againſt it: So that Mr <hi>White</hi> had reaſon to ſay, he that refuſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Church, if his thoughts be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52610:107"/>

Tranſubſtantiation, but ſo gently that the difficulties which you would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to Omnipotency, are (almoſt) as familiar and ordinary events as any we converſe with. But for the firſt, That Chriſt ſhould begin to be, and not to be, how do you verifie either part? or infer from our doctrine there is a time when Chriſt is not? Which is neceſſary to the truth of your Propoſition: Tis true, that this half hour he is not upon the Altar, the next he is; but ſure it could not eſcape you, that, not to be upon the Altar, and not to be are two very different things. Now I am ſure you do not wonder to ſee a Wart or Pimple to grow and periſh; which nevertheleſs, while they live, have no diſtinct being from the being of the man they grow upon, that is, are that man, and yet ceaſe to be, without cauſing the man to do ſo. And for thoſe that follow, that Chriſt is broken, and not broken, in one place, and in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, pray conſider that the multiplicity of forms our Saviour vouchſafes to put his ſacred Body under, is to his body, as quantity or extenſion to ſubſtance. A man is but one thing and no more; his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52610:108"/>
hands, his feet, and whatever elſe go to the making up of man, being not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, but entring all into the unity of this truly one man; and this man by one of his feet is in one place, by another, not in that, but another place: Cut his hair, or nail, he is truly divided (that is, according to that part which is truly he) and truly remains one.</p>
               <p>Now raiſe your thoughts, and conſider how very little more faith this great myſtery requires of you, no more then that you will permit the Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do that by the multitude of forms, with which he is pleaſed to cloth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which nature does every day by means of quantity, and ſee whether it be not very unjuſt (to ſay no more) to deny that to omnipotence, which the ordinary courſe of cauſes does ſo perpetually bring forth, that it never concerns your wonder, and ſeldom your notice. You will find ſome diſparity in theſe ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and ſo you muſt, for <hi>nullum ſimile eſt idem,</hi> but if I miſtake not you will find the very knot of the difficulty the ſame in both, though the manner of tying be different; and however it be a

You next make this Queſtion; <hi>if we have derived this Interpretation all along from the Apoſtles?</hi> which ſuppoſes the foundation of all our Doctrines to be an Interpretation of Scripture, a Poſition diſownd, as you know, by us; but if the Queſtion be, as I preſume you meant it, <hi>Whether we have derived this Doctrine all along from the Apoſtles.</hi> I anſwer yes, and appeal even to your ſelf, whether it were in the power of the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which you generally take to be the firſt, which ſetled that doctrine, or any other authority upon the face of the earth, to impoſe, upon whole nations, tenets, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to themſelves and poſterity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible not to be ſeen to be ſo; what is there beyond the power of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if this be not, That mankind, brought up in a beleef, that the Bleſſed Sacrament is no more then plain bread, made to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie higher things indeed, but only to ſignifie them, ſhould of a ſudden unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly run to Maſs, there adore the holy Sacrifice, and by vaſt Alms acknowledg it propitiatory for both quick and dead? Obſerve how ſlowly and warily the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of <hi>Trent</hi> has been admitted into the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52610:111"/>
ſeveral Provinces of Chriſtendom, into all which, even the Catholick ones, it has not yet, nor perhaps ever will, as to decrees of manners, gain'd an entire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and confeſſe the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things endures not ſo extravagant a power, even in Councils, as to change the faith of the world, which it profeſſes with this perſwaſion, that eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe depends upon it, according to an arbitrary determination, and that the making of a new word ſhould make new truths, nay make that true to day which was falſe yeſterday.</p>
               <p>There Sir are impoſſibilities in nature, and may enter into a large fancy, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſe from thence into a ſober Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing being more certain, then that, as great as the Power of a Council is, it is ſo far from being able to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a new faith with a new word, that it could never have introduced a new word which had not been found agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the old faith.</p>
               <p>Before I ſpeak to your Fathers, who, you ſay, are ſo clear againſt us, give me leave to ſpeak a little to your ſelf; and put you in mind that you and I are now
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52610:112"/>
diſputing, not of an obſcure peece of Criticiſm, or unconcerning point of Philoſophy, in which a miſtake is of no greater concern than the credit of the miſtaker, but of Religion, that is the way to Heaven, in which, if we miſſe, we have the ſame hopes of comming thither, that he has of getting to his journeys end by night who travels all day in a wrong road. Our Souls therefore, and their Salvation being concerned in this conteſt, no plea ought to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but ſuch a one, of whoſe efficacy we are ſo far perſwaded as to venture them upon it.</p>
               <p>Now by the great candor you profeſs, have the Fathers you cite, ſo much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with you? are you content ſo to ſubmit your judgement to theirs, as, when it appears what the path is they walked in, to quit all others for it, and conſtantly purſue it to eternity? ſuch, and only ſuch a diſpoſition may make the pains requiſite to ſo great an effect, as clearing the ſence of the Fathers in all points of controverſy, rationally chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: but if you have it not, the whole buſineſſe is turn'd into a wit-combat, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52610:112"/>
the Queſtion no more but this, whether of us two are better vers'd in Antiquity? and truly, me thinks, the concern of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity deſerves to be treated a little more ſeriouſly, then, if what is alleaged, prove true, nothing is advanced, if falſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing loſt; which yet I take to be your caſe; for if the Fathers ſay, as you would have them, you profeſſe not to rely upon them, if otherwiſe, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them.</p>
               <p>But I am afraid your manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fathers is more liable to excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then your treating them. For, (to omit the want of rigorous exactneſſe in ſome of your Teſtimonies, which uſes to accompany thoſe citations which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly your own,) you have brought a Quotation from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which you make look like an entire Text, that proves, when examined, a collection of ſeveral ſentences, ſome not ſo much as his, ſcattered through ſeveral books, in ſeveral Tomes, and cite for it a book never written, at leaſt by him. This proceeding, I dare ſay, is not yours, and I would intreat you, ſince you refuſe to rely upon the Fathers, not to hazard
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52610:113"/>
your own, or eternal happineſſe, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery, upon the credit of, you know beſt whom, but in all likelyhood, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their being men, that is, in your principles, not to be rely'd on, becauſe fallible) engaged by intereſt or affection into a partiality, which ſhould be more ſuſpicious to you, then the bare fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuch men as the Fathers; and whoever they be, I may ſafely ſay, not comparable either in learning or virtue to thoſe great ornaments of the Church of God. If ever you think fit to look into them, take my counſel, and look with your own, not other mens eyes; 'Tis your ſelf are concerned; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it injuſtice to yield a ſubmiſſion to any body elſe, which you deny the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Next do not only read them, by ſtarts I mean, as an occaſional citation invites you, but ſtudy them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere with diligence from the beginning to the end of that piece you deſire to be Maſter of; and then if you be truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd, and bring a willingneſſe to embrace what you find, I am as confident you will find the truth this way, as I think it extreamly difficult, not to ſay
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52610:113"/>
impoſſible, you ſhould come to it by any other.</p>
               <p>It would perhaps, not have been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conſider a little in this place the nature of Arguments drawn from <hi>Fathers;</hi> for neither do we hold this conſequence neceſſary; A father affirms this, therefore this is true. But having been already lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longer then I intended, give me leave to refer you for that point to Mr <hi>Whites Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie Logick,</hi> and only propoſe you this ſhort reflexion; that ſince a Father is a Father, in as much as he propagates that kind in which he is a Father, that is in our caſe, the Church, and the Church is a company of faithful, and who are <hi>faithful,</hi> is to be known by the <hi>rule of faith,</hi> that point muſt firſt be ſetled, before any claim can be made either to father, or Church, ſince without it you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirm of any man that he is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor of any company of men, that 'tis a Church.</p>
               <p>Farther, ſince a Father as ſuch, is not a Doctor or deducer of Conſequences, (for ſo every Doctor of Divinity would be a Father) nor a Homiliſt, nor Commentator, for the ſame reaſon, you will find the word,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52610:114"/>
ſtrictly look'd into, imports a propagator of Chriſtian faith, by witneſſing what the Church held in the time for which he witneſſeth; but ſo as that the witneſs, by reaſon either of his eminency in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dignity of place, or both, or by being an avowed Champion of the Churches Doctrine againſt her enemies cannot be conceived ignorant of the Churches ſence in his days. To go therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to work, your Teſtimonies from Fathers, ſhould be from men thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, ſpeaking as witneſſes, the words, though of the ſame men, if under other capacities, being not properly the words of Fathers, but of Schollers, Preachers, or what other capacity they ſpeak in. And to theſe juſt bounds, would you, as you ought confine your quotations, alas, how ſmall a ſhew would Antiquity afford you? perhaps not four in her whole extent. Your preſent appearance will, I doubt, by this reflexion, be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be made out of falſe Muſters; nevertheleſs in condeſcendence to you, let us now examine what you ſay, and let me wonder what you ſay; firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the firſt Ages were clearly againſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52610:114"/>
us. Pray what have you, or can you have to juſtifie an Aſſertion of that ſound? perhaps you will ſay the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of theſe times. But I ſhould think that thoſe who do not write, are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more conſiderable in number, and no leſſe in value, then thoſe who do; and do not believe you can aſſign a reaſon why the Title and credit of ſo glorious a title as an Age ſhould be taken from them who certainly beſt deſerve it, but of whoſe ſenſe you have no account at all, to be given to thoſe few who have given an account of their ſence, but do not at al deſerv the title.</p>
               <p>Again, even of thoſe few who have written, how many are loſt, and never deſcended down to us, who for any thing we know to the contrary, may not have been of the ſame opinion with thoſe whoſe writings we have. If I ſhould write now, and you write againſt me, but ſo as my Book have the fortune to be preſerved, yours not: Will you not think the Age wrong'd, if a thouſand years hence they conclude that to be the ſence of it which they find in my Book? Caſt up your accounts therefore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and you will find the ſum total
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52610:115"/>
of your Age to be two or three Writers in every hundred years, who are ſo far from making the ſence of the firſt Ages to be againſt us (for they are of our ſide too) that they do not ſo much as make it appear what it was: Yet ſince you ſeem to put a confidence in them, let us ſee to whom they will be more favourable.</p>
               <p>Your firſt from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> we look upon as ſo far from being clearly againſt us, that we uſe to produce it on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; conceiving it expreſſes very clearly that what was common Bread before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, does by vertue thereof <hi>(accepta vocatione)</hi> ceaſe to be what it was, and becomes Euchariſt, in which are both earthly qualities, colour, taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and heavenly ſubſtance, the body of Chriſt. A ſecond view will, I am confident, ſhew you this to be the ſence of the place, and cauſe you to agree in this particular with <hi>Luther,</hi> who, in his <hi>Defenſ. verb. Coen.</hi> is of opinion that the <hi>vocare Dei</hi> did make the things to be vvhat they vvere called, and that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> uſed the word in that ſence.</p>
               <p>The next from <hi>Tertullian</hi> is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with as great, though a more eaſie miſtake; his obſcurity being very often
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52610:115"/>
not penetrable but to laborious and obſtinate induſtry; but if you pleaſe to look upon the place and throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, you will find his meaning was, not that this, which he ſays our Saviour made his body: was only a figure of his body, but that what anciently was a figure of his body, he then made his body; for his whole deſign being to prove that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour fulfilled the figures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the place objected provs particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fulfilling that of Bread which being by the Prophet, <hi>conjiciamus lignum in panem ejus,</hi> uſed for a Figure of his body, he ſays is the reaſon why he took rather Bread then any other thing to change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſacred body.</p>
               <p>The following ones, all but <hi>Theodorets,</hi> have the ſame difficulty, all witneſſing the Bleſſed Euchariſt to be an Antitype a figure, a ſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the body and blood of Chriſt; and that it is ſo, and uſually, and well called ſo, we agree, but that the Fathers ever meant it ſo a Figure, or ſign as to exclude the thing ſignified, we deny, and conceive it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you ſhould prove. In what ſenſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52610:116"/>
they called it ſo you may, if you pleaſe, learn from the laſt words of your Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony attributed by you to S. <hi>Austin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Didim.</hi> who never wrote any ſuch Book that I know of, but found in the Canon, <hi>Hoc eſt de Conſecr.</hi> and ſaid indeed to be taken out of him. Theſe now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the conſecrated Bread to be truly the fleſh of Chriſt, and yet a Sacrament alſo, or ſign of his Body. How? ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>illius,</hi> viz. <hi>quod viſibile palpabile mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale in cruce poſitum eſt;</hi> that is, this body now immortal, now inviſible ſignifies or brings into our mind this ſame body as mortal, as viſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being it ſelf in a different form a ſign of it ſelf. <hi>Vocatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ipſa immolatio carnis</hi> the ſacrifice, mark you, of what? Of fleſh) <hi>quae ſacerdotis manibus fit,</hi> that is, the Maſs, <hi>Chriſti paſſio &amp;c. non rei veritate ſed ſignificante myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio;</hi> for the Prieſt does not truly cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, truly kill our Saviour, but miſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent to us by ſacrificing his now impaſſible body, that great, and onely once performed Sacrifice offered upon the Croſs in the ſame body when paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Both actions, truly Sacrifice, both Victims, truly body, and the ſame body,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52610:116"/>
but one, under one form, a Sacrament, or ſign of it ſelf under another.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſame thing in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent relation, may be a ſign, or figure, or image of it ſelf, I hope will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrange to you, if you reflect, that <hi>God the Son is the image of his Fathers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the ſame ſubſtance was made into the likeneſs of man, and yet truly man,</hi> &amp;c. And your Argument, 'tis a ſign or figure, therefore not ſubſtance, is common to you with the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> who argued Chriſt, becauſe in Image, therefore not in truth a ſervant, no man, becauſe in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a man; and becauſe in figure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not in ſubſtance a man; for which they are reprehended and confuted by <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cont. Marc. c.</hi> 20. So that your Argument, were it good, proves more then you intended, and perhaps imagined, and not onely takes away our Saviours bodie from the bleſſed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, but leaves him none to take away; for certainly the ſame Argument is the ſame, whether in <hi>Marcions</hi> mouth or in yours, and there is no remedy but you muſt either relinquiſh it, or cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh him. In ſhort what wonder,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52610:117"/>
that it is called a ſign, when it cannot be a Sacrament without being ſo? all our Queſtion is, Whether it be a meer ſign? This the Teſtimonies ſhould <hi>expreſs,</hi> and not leave to the Readers gloſs.</p>
               <p>There remains <hi>Theodoret,</hi> ſaying, <hi>the nature is not changed, but grace added to it.</hi> But what is meant by <hi>nature,</hi> then which a more equivocal word ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accurs, is the Queſtion. In our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpeech very often, and in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers moſt frequently, the proper quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a thing uſe to be called natural, and nature; and that <hi>Theodoret</hi> meant no more by the word here, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the nature, that is, the taſte, colour, ſhape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of bread was not changed) I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeve, both from this very place, which tells us we are not to look to the nature, or outward appearances of what is ſeen, but, for the change of names, to beleeve the change made by grace, which change I conceive to be a real, not moral onely change, of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not office; ſince then the Bread by conſecration ſhould become a ſign of Chriſts body (which if you will beleeve <hi>Tertullian</hi> it was before) is no ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52610:117"/>
as to deſerve a change of names to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our faith, and be manifeſt onely <hi>myſteriis initiatis.</hi> But more by what he ſays in his <hi>ſecond Dialogue,</hi> where he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us the myſtical ſigns are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be that which they are made, and are beleeved, and <hi>adored</hi> as being the things which they are beleeved. Now what think you, was <hi>Theodoret</hi> of your opinion that maintains ſuch a change by vertue of conſecration as brings in adoration with it? May bread be adored, let it ſignifie what it will? unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly therefore, he held ſuch a change as made the bread to be no longer bread, but a fit object of adoration. And that it may appear the reſt of the Fathers were of his mind, and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I make of their ſayings, not obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon them, but purely their own true ſentiments: I ſhall preſent you with a ſhort taſte of their judgment, leaving you in caſe it ſtir your appetite to deſire it, for a fuller meal, to the large ſtore of their own writings, which if you pleaſe to fall upon, I am confident you cannot bring a hunger, which will not meet with full ſatietie.</p>

The Firſt is from <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> l. 3. de ſpir. ſanct. c. 12. <hi>Itaque per ſcabellum terra intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatur, per terram autem caro Chriſti, quam hodie quoque in myſteriis adoramus, &amp; quam Apoſtoli in Domino Jeſu, ut ſupra diximus adorarunt:</hi> By a footſtool therefore let

earth be underſtood, by earth the fleſh of Chriſt, which even at this day, we <hi>adore</hi> in the myſteries, and which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as I ſaid before, adored in our Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The next from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> explicating the ſame words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. <hi>Suſcepit enim de terra terram, quia caro de terra eſt, &amp; de carne Mariae carnem accepit; &amp; quia in ipſa carne hic ambulavit, &amp; ipſam carnem nobis manducandam ad ſalutem dedit, nemo autem illam carnem manducaverit, niſi prius adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit, Juventum eſt quomodo adoretur tale ſcabellum pedum Domini, &amp; non ſolum non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemus adorando, ſed peccemus non adorando.</hi> For of earth he took earth, becauſe fleſh is of earth, and of the fleſh of <hi>Mary</hi> he took fleſh; and becauſe he walked here in that fleſh, and gave us that fleſh to be eaten unto ſalvation, and none eats that fleſh without having firſt adored it; We have found how ſuch a footſtool of the feet of our Lord may be adored, and how we do not only not ſin in adoring it, but ſin in not adoring it.</p>
               <p>Theſe few I have choſen out of many, enough, I hope to ſatisfie you, that 'tis very far from plain, that the firſt Ages
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52610:124"/>
were cleerly againſt us. And that thoſe whoſe forward confidence has perſwaded you to think ſo, have very much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confidence you put in them; it being not poſſible, for our ſelves at this day, to expreſs more plainly then thoſe great lights of the Church have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: That <hi>our ſenſes are not in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be truſted; that they may, but the Word of God cannot deceive us; that what we ſee in the bleſſed Euchariſt is not what nature framed; not Bread and Wine, though to our ſenſes it ſeem ſo; but the body and blood of Chriſt, that blood which redeemed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that very thing which did flow from his ſide; which the Sages ſaw and adored in the manger; that at which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in beholding, tremble, nor are able to look upon without fear; that which no man received without firſt adoring, and which, in fine, 'tis ſin not to adore.</hi>

Prayer to Saints, alleged as an Innovation, &amp; ſo a proof of the uncertainty of Traditions, and their corruptions; the firſt Argument from the opinion of the Fathers, who held that the ſouls of Saints were not admitted into heaven before the day of Judgment,</hi> Mr. White <hi>only ſays, he does not beleeve it their opinion, but he ſhould have proved they did not, I wiſh the Arguments brought were ſet down by</hi> Mr. White, <hi>but ſuppoſing they held Saints were not admitted, he ſees no conſequence, which I exceedingly wonder at, what? Eagle-eyed</hi> Mr. White <hi>not ſee it? No wonder indeed, when he changes the very queſtion, which with what ingenuitie it is done, I leave to you his friend to judge: the Queſtion was in the firſt line of the page, Prayer to Saints, he ſays ſuppoſe they were not, may they not nevertheleſs pray for us? I pray</hi> Mr. White, <hi>Is there not a great vaſt difference between theſe two, the Saints pray for us, and we may pray to the Saints, ſuppoſe the Saints not yet in heaven pray for us, the Church of God in general, not knowing every ones particular condition, may they not do it without Superſtition or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry? For a particular man here, may and ſhould pray for the welfare of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

Sea, but can the Church beyond Sea, all the members of it, in whatſoever place or time by night or day, pray unto the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man here in</hi> England, <hi>to pray to God for them, without Idolatry, ſeeing the man here they all pray to muſt know the prayers they make whether by night or by day, whether he be aſleep or awake, whether many of them pray together in ſeveral places, or onely one at once, and is it not Idolatry? Suppoſe every man of you in</hi> England, <hi>upon every occaſion you had ſhould pray to the Pope, to get help for you from God; one in this Town is a praying for health; another at the ſame hour in</hi> Wales <hi>for deliverance from Robbers, another at midnight, when the Pope is aſleep, prays for pardon of ſin, I think you will ſay this is Idolatry, making a God of a man, whom you ſuppoſe by praying, to hear and know your particular conditions; but it is a quite other matter, if the Pope ſhould pray for all of you in general, (as we do for the whole Church) though he knew not your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wants: The Conſequence then which admirable</hi> Mr. White <hi>cannot ſee, is ſtrong and good, for if you grant, the Fathers held Saints were not admitted into heaven, they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52610:125"/>
held they were not to be prayed unto; becauſe before admiſſion, they could not know every mans condition, that laid it open to them in prayer, what ſay you? could they not yet be admitted, know every mans condition or not? If not, why doe you pray to them that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear you? If they know (which</hi> Mr. White <hi>ſeems to hold in bringing</hi> Jeremiah <hi>praying for the people) then indeed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not forcing, and indeed unleſſe</hi> Mr. White <hi>think ſo, be does but fumble, as bad as your Seraphim of Divines (ſo yours call</hi> Aquinas) <hi>about this very queſtion, which by reaſon of the badneſs of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net contradicts himſelf in the compaſs of two leaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">¶ 1. This Section treats of Prayer to Saints, and the firſt Paraph is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making good a conſequence, which you acknowledge little importing whether true or no, ſince Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anſwer is, as you confeſs, that which he relies upon, nay which you acknowledg to be not forcing, that is not good, and none in that opinion which Mr. <hi>White</hi> maintains for true, <hi>Viz</hi> That
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52610:126"/>
Saints even before admiſſion into Heaven know every mans condition. I cannot tell therefore whether reaſon will juſtifie my pains in examining, what before I begin is confeſſed to be nothing to the purpoſe; and yet the bitter confidence of your cloſe, which calls Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Diſcourſe <hi>trifles,</hi> and <hi>ſigns of a rotten cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. prevails with me to let you ſee thoſe terms do not become an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Premiſes beſides being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, are alſo many ways nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I obſerve, that in the very place you charge Mr. <hi>White</hi> with want of ingenuity, you would have much ado to defend your ſelf, from a ſevere Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; pray, if I ſhould urge it, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could you aſſign of changing his Objection, That divers Fathers held non-admiſſion before the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into this expreſſion, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers held it, which ſignifies all, or the univerſality of them, his, importing but a few. But, though you give me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I will not be rigorous, and proceed to tell you, 'tis both unjuſt and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52610:126"/>
to exact the proof you do. Let thoſe prove the Fathers held the opinion, who ſay they did, elſe a bare denial is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Confutation of a bare Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the proof as you know very well, belonging to the Plaintiff, not Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. But beſides Mr. <hi>White</hi> diſclaims medling with the point, and 'tis a ſtrange ſeverity in you to quarrel at the want of a proof where there is not ſo much as an Argument, and to be angry for not finding what you are told beforehand is not there to find; yet if your curioſitie perſevere, you may, if you pleaſe, ſee the ground of Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> opinion in his <hi>Middle ſtate of Souls, Acc.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we muſt ſee what is to be ſaid to the alteration you accuſe him to have made of the Queſtion: which firſt, I will hope, you look not upon as deſign, for no man plays foul play but for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and 'tis the ſame thing to him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints hear us, or hear us not before admiſſion. You ſee he maintains the opinion of non-admiſsion to be falſe, and therefore cannot be concerned what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, in caſe it be, for argument ſake, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:52610:127"/>Next, though it ſeem but odly ſpent time, which is imployed in gueſſing, and beſides himſelf no body can do more, at the reaſon of the accident, yet I beleeve from the experience I have of him, I may confidently affirm this paſſage to be one of thoſe obſcurities, which his great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiveneſs upon ſence, and ſmall care of expreſſion makes every body complain of in him. Neither is this the firſt time that his overmuch minding the thing he would diſcourſe of, has made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſom link neceſſary to the chain of his diſcourſe; which had it been made in this manner, the Saints whether admitted or not admitted, may pray for us, and do know whether we pray to them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Objection is of no force; your ſelf would have, and have allowed.</p>
               <p>Now that ſecond Propoſition is to him ſo cleer a truth, holding that our blindneſs here is from the cloud of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which darkens every thing, and which the ſoul being freed from, finds no obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity impenetrable to her natural activity, that he never reflected other people would find a difficulty where himſelf ſaw none; I beg leave therefore to add it for him, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52610:127"/>
undertake to defend it againſt the aſſaults your next Paraph makes upon it; though I apprehend my ſelf not otherwiſe oblig'd to ſo much, then by the deſire I have to proceed according to the rules, not of ſtrict diſputation, but civility: For would I inſiſt upon it, how could you juſtifie your cleer-ſightedneſs, and this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which, though Mr. <hi>White</hi> could not, you ſaw was good; if the Fathers held non-admiſsion, they held no prayer? becauſe, ſay you, they knew not, before admiſsion every mans condition. This you ſee I have denied; but, put caſe I had not, I am afraid you would come ſhort of your account.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Fathers are alledged by <hi>Veron,</hi> an excellent French Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſt, to maintain prayer to Saints, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while they doubted whether theſe Saints heard the prayers made to them: And you may reflect, that prayer to Saints, is a part of <hi>Tradition</hi> rivetted into our hearts by an univerſal and undeniable practiſe; but whether ſouls, freed from the commerce of bodies, receive intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of what paſſes among bodies; and this again either from the nature of their
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52610:128"/>
ſtate, or divine revelation: Whether the return of our prayers to Saints be from their mediation, or only from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God making uſe of our affection to creatures like our ſelves, to give us thoſe benefits, which otherwiſe we had never demanded, and ſo never received, and the like, are School queſtions, in which ſpeculative wits, according to the difference of their learning and ſtudie, have met with either truth or error, but acting all the while as Schollers, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubting the lawfulneſs of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which occaſioned all theſe diſputes, and which they ſaw firmly ſetled upon a more ſolid foundation then all their School-learning, for had they done ſo, they had diſputed it, as well as the reſt.</p>
               <p>To take then all parts of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tis falſe, the Fathers held non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is falſe, that non-admiſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ignorance of our condition; laſtly, 'tis falſe, that non admiſſion and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both of them exclude prayers to Saints, that is, in the Fathers judgement (for the Queſtion is not what is true or falſe, but what they held to be ſo) ſince they prayed to them even then when they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52610:128"/>
doubted whether they were heard or no. Now I beſeech you reflect, if to reject ſuch arguments be a ſign of a rotten cauſe, what it is to be perſwaded by them, and perſwaded in matters of no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern then eternity?</p>
               <p n="2">¶ 2. <hi>Suppoſe that be</hi> Mr. Whites <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Saints know what we pray to them before they are admitted into heaven, is that your Tenet? To what purpoſe elſe does he bring</hi> Jeremies <hi>praying in the</hi> Macchabees, <hi>to ſay that he prays in general (as we do for the whole Church, though we know not its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtate) is nothing to the purpoſe, the Queſtion is, Whether we may pray to the Saints, and in order to our praying to them, whether they can know every particular mans prayer; if you ſay they do, you and your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal Book, contradict the undoubted Word of God, by his Prophet,</hi> Iſai 63.16. <hi>Abraham</hi> knows us not, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ignorant of us, <hi>which your S.</hi> Thomas <hi>can no otherwiſe ſolve, then by imagining the Saints before Chriſt were not yet admitted to Heaven.</hi>

of my underſtanding to your words, which you refuſe the Church; and give me leave to put you in mind you cannot affirm it contrary to that Scripture, till you be aſſured what that Scripture is; and farther, ſince Scripture cannot be contrary to it ſelf, 'tis lawful for me to beleeve, you may as ſoon miſs the ſence of it, as Mr. <hi>White,</hi> whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Anſwer, you in the next place, call a <hi>naked, groundleſs, not proved Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and for <hi>naked,</hi> I think you mean want of either proof or ground, for ſure you will not except againſt the want of Rhetorick, and then 'tis the ſame with one of the other expreſſions: To the firſt of which I reply he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the ground of it, <hi>Viz.

According to the ſmall inſight I have in Logick, no argument either requires, or can have a fuller anſwer, then a plain denial of its premiſes, which I take to be done here.</p>
               <p>The Argument is this, Divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you ſay the Fathers, held
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52610:130"/>
non-admiſſion before the day of judgment, wherefore they muſt alſo hold no prayer to Saints: Now, if I aver the admiſſion of Saints before the day of Judgment is taught by Tradition, I think I ſay alſo, that it was taught by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and conſequently deny they taught the contrary and muſt beleeve, till I am better inſtructed in the Laws of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, when thus much is ſaid to an Argument, more ought not, and perhaps cannot be ſaid. Let me add nevertheleſs in this place, that were the antecedent true of <hi>divers Fathers,</hi> if the Conſequent be recommended by <hi>Tradition,</hi> we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reject the Apoſtle, or refuſe to admit of any Plea, not only of Fathers, but even Angels againſt it.</p>

You next demand the ground of this Aſſertion, and whether the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Saints be deſcended by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the Apoſtles? No Sir, I have told you already it belongs not to Faith, but Divinity, where, if you pleaſe to take the pains neceſſary, you may find it proved true, but not of faith; ſuch things belong to the School, not the Church, who will not refuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to any for refuſing to beleeve it. The practice of praying to Saints, <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> has, by immemorial cuſtome, ſetled her in poſſeſſion of; how that practice is reconciled to Philoſophy, whether by the omniſcience of Saints, by divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or other diſpoſition of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is diſputed in the Schools: while her aim of bringing her Subjects to the eſteem and practice of vertue, by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of thoſe whom the practiſe of it has made ſo glorious, is perfectly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without thoſe ſubtleties, which have no other influence upon our actions, then as fences or out-works, which it belongs to Divinity both to maintain and enlarge; but ſo as that an Error in it does not weaken her hold which is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52610:131"/>
built upon a much ſtronger foundation: Mean time while you ask, if the Fathers held ſo groſs abſurdities; if you mean om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience of Saints, you ſee I maintain it to be no abſurdity, but a great and certain truth; if you mean non omniſcience, I hope you will hereafter be leſs earneſt in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what your ſelf call a groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, in either caſe give me leave to tell you, that for divers Fathers (for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, <hi>the Fathers,</hi> which imports them all, fair dealing will not receive into its place) to hold an opinion in matters of learning, which after ages diſcovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintainable, I take to be a conceit very far from abſurdity.</p>

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:52610:133"/>¶ 6. Your next Paraph paſſes from the invocation of Saints, to their vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in the firſt place reprehends ſome anſwers, it ſeems you have met with, under the name of <hi>new coin'd diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> And how to juſtifie them, or know whether they are juſtifiable, except you had expreſſed them, I cannot tell: but in general, to quarrel at the uſe of diſtinctions, ſeems extremely unjuſt, it being impoſsible, without them, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any certainty by the means of words; for there being few, perhaps not any, which are not uſed in many ſences, what imagination can fancy a poſſibility of fixing upon any one ſenſe by a ſound, which is common to many, till they are diſtinguiſhed one from another, and the particular ſignification applied to the general word?</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee how you come to be ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the oppoſition of our Tenet to Scripture: You ſay S. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalips</hi> was forbidden to worſhip the Angel with that religious worſhip we offer to Saints, but have no warrant from the place, to ſay ſo, where there is no word to inform us what kind
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52610:133"/>
of worſhip it was which the Saint offer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, and the Angel refuſed, and you know how dangerous additions or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are: there appears no more then barely worſhip offered and refuſed; whereof you are ſo intent upon the latter, that you quite forget the former, which nevertheleſs ſeems important enough to deſerve a reflexion; for if worſhip were offered, and offered by <hi>S. John,</hi> that illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and beloved Apoſtle, and this when, as you ſay, he was aware it was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to whom he offered it, I cannot ſee but to deny Angel-worſhip is to ſay that great Apoſtle either knew not what was lawful, or acted what he knew unlawful; two Aſſertions, which to embrace, I think, nothing but the neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending an ill cauſe, can ingage a man; For my part I muſt deſire none will take it amiſs, if I regulate my actions by thoſe of the beloved Diſciple, and think al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable whatever he thought ſo.</p>
               <p>But to look neerer on the place, the worſhip there mentioned being of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to be ſuppoſed either due or not due; I know ſeveral things are ſaid to render a reaſon why the Angel might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52610:134"/>
it, in the firſt Suppoſition; and the Saint be miſtaken to offer it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; but either I underſtand nothing, or neither Suppoſition affords ground enough to raiſe a battery againſt us; for if it be put due, whatever the reaſon might be of the Angels refuſal, we ſhall be very unjuſtly quarrelled at, for giving every one what's their due. Paying of of debts, ſure, will not become oppoſite to Scripture, if not due, what wonder if the Angel refuſed it? And whatever might be the reaſon of the Apoſtles mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, this is certain, that out of this, that an undue honour was refuſed, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver follow that a due one may not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That which we give muſt be firſt proved undue, and unlawful, before it can be concluded againſt by the refuſal of one which was ſo. For, that ſome worſhip is due, ſure none, but a Quaker, will deny, ſince certainly an Angel is as good a perſon as a Juſtice of Peace, to whom nevertheleſs, I hope, by the grace of God, we may ſay without Idolatry, <hi>if it pleaſe your Worſhip.</hi> And for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip,</hi> which ſeems to ſtick with you, I doubt there is a miſtake, but know
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52610:134"/>
not how to rectifie it, if you bar the uſe of diſtinctions, whoſe ſervice if you had pleaſed to make uſe of, ſo far, as to have look'd into the ſeveral notions of the Word, my ſervice would have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> then ſignifies the worſhip of God, and <hi>Religious</hi> by conſequence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, or relating to the worſhip of God, and this in ſeveral, and unequal reſpects; as when we ſay a religious man, houſe, book, demeanour, &amp;c. we mean thoſe perſons, or things have relation, though differently, to the ſervice of God. Now the beſt and moſt proper ſent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs, is in a ſoul, and ſince no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can be more, or ſo much, eſteemable, we conceive the ſoul, which has it to be valuable, or to have worth; the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of which, we call <hi>worſhip,</hi> that is teſtimony of worth.</p>
               <p>Farther this worſhip, being founded, not on the worth riſing from natural, or acquired parts, from eminence of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or any civil conſideration, but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſupernatural, or religious endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we call religious worſhip, and mean by it an acknowledgment of worth,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52610:135"/>
ſpringing from this, that the perſons to whom we give it, are highly in the favor of God, meerly as ſuch, without mixture of any other conſideration. This kind of worſhip then, is therefore called <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> becauſe it aims at God, being given to perſons highly dear to him; and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſcore, that they are ſo, and nothing is more plain from common ſence, then that he who honours a perſon, purely as loving another, does by that act heartily honor that other.</p>
               <p>From the action of <hi>Cornelius</hi> what you would infer, I am left to gueſs, all the uſe you make, being to ask whether he took S. <hi>Peter</hi> for God? to which after I have replyed, that I conceive he did not, I know not what more to ſay: but me thinks Catholike Religion has a ſtrange Fate, that no act of Chriſtian modeſtie, and humilitie can paſs without being ſtraind into an oppoſition to it.</p>
               <p>The laſt place is <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. whence you would prove the Divel did not deſire to be worſhipped as God, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed God: Good Sir, does the Divel act according to his knowledg? and can you be ignorant his miſery conſiſts in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52610:135"/>
obſtinate adheſion to things againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and which he ſees to be ſo? Has he changed his mind, think you, ſince the fatal <hi>Ero ſimilis altiſſimo?</hi> This was ſtrangely argued, but to wreſt the place againſt our Tenet, is, I think, ſtranger; it being to ſay men may not honour <hi>(ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerari)</hi> Angels, becauſe God refuſed to adore the Divel. How little conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did you uſe with your own thoughts in this Paragraph? but you reply, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Devil, our Saviour might have worſhipped him, and his Father both: Which ſeems to me to evince, paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that the worſhip deſired by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was ſuch a one as was due to God: for had he meant onely a teſtimony of that excellence which was in him, do you think him ignorant of it who created it? or backward to expreſs his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it in neceſſary circumſtances, who is juſtice it ſelf? Evidently therefore the Devil deſired what belonged not to him, and ought not to hinder thoſe happy ſpirits from receiving Veneration to whom it does belong; and yet we are ſo unfortunate as to evacuate the Law of God by true Traditions, while you have
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52610:136"/>
the happineſs to preſerve it by untrue Interpretations.</p>

               <p>To come now to your Citations: The firſt is from <hi>Origen, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>in Ep. ad Rom.</hi> where one half of the period is quite cut off, and the ſence of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half, fixt upon one part of the words, the reſt being ſuppreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſt as if, out of this Period, <hi>I will go to</hi> London <hi>on horsback,</hi> one ſhould leave the laſt words, and prove, out of the former, I meant to go on foot.

               <p>There follows <hi>S.

Nay, his ſence in that point is ſo very cleer, that I am at a loſs how to contrive a way, being very unwilling to impute it to wilfulneſs, by which he ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For the Queſtion diſputed in that Book, being, whether it avail a dead man, that his body be inter'd neer the ſhrine of a Martyr; S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> maintains the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative upon this ground, That ſuch a Poſition cauſes the man to be more often and more lively recommended to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Martyr by the prayers of the living; and how he, who juſtifies the choice of place in burial, by the advantage received in being recommended to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a Martyr, ſhould be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doubt whether there be any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or no, and think it unlawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, the ſhortneſs of my ſight cannot diſcover.</p>
               <p>He is indeed (in his 13<hi rend="sup">h</hi>

as newly die, or from Angels, or it may be from God himſelf; however it be, he moſt evidently and undeniably aſſerts the cuſtome in his time of praying for the dead, and praying for them to Saints. To make an end of this authority, there being in this matter, as in all others, to be diſtinguiſhed what is Faith, from what is Learning; the firſt being no more then barely, that 'tis good and profitable to have recourſe to the aſſiſtance of Saints: To the laſt belonging many Queſtions, in ſome ages more doubtful, in ſome, as truth opens to time and induſtry, more ſetled, but ſtill remaining points of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not faith; I onely deſire of you that you will pleaſe to be of that Faith in this Point which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> plainly and unqueſtionably delivers in this very Book, which being inſiſted on by your ſelf, I do not ſee you can offer leſs, and promiſe I will expect no more: Marry, becauſe in a point of School-learning he maintains an opinion now generally diſallowed; to infer, he was againſt the practiſe of the Church, becauſe his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he was wrong, may be conceived oppoſite to it, when he both
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52610:140"/>
plainly atteſts, and approves the practice, and uſes much diligence and ſtudie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his Poſition to it, is a proceeding I had rather you ſhould correct, then I cenſure.</p>
               <p>There follow two paſſages out of two Invectives of S. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> which I ſee are examples of <hi>Proſopopoeia,</hi> and no more in them; but doubt whether the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſertion be ſtranger, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of it, with a <hi>ſo that,</hi> as if becauſe S. <hi>Gregory</hi> above 300 years after Chriſt, made uſe of a Rhetorical figure, therefore in the firſt 200 yeers, there was no Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints. To the thing it ſelf, I ſhall ſay no more; then humbly deſire you to beware of blind obedience and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith, of condemning and practiſing the ſame thing, and if you will believe fallible men, to beleeve the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not what more fallible men tell you of them. I would gladly know alſo what thoſe, you give ſo much credit to, do bring to juſtifie themſelves, and their ſaying, that in that time there was no Invocation. I do not beleeve they produce any plain place which deny ſuch practiſes were, or were lawful to be uſed;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52610:140"/>
and conceive, they either argue from the ſilence of ſome of them, that there was no ſuch thing, becauſe they ſay nothing of it, which (beſides that it wildly ſuppoſes whatſoever was writ in theſe Ages, came ſafely down to us) is as much as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that whatever ſubject a man chuſes for his Book, he muſt treat of all things in it; or elſe make uſe of, perhaps their Errors, in School points, as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſouls departed, the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of commerce betwixt the next world and this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to overthrow what they might, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> long after clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, held true, even while they held theſe errors, and this, (to ſay nothing of the injuſtice it does the Fathers, to extend a miſtake of theirs in a point of learning, without ſufficient ground, to their faith too,) is in ſtead of diſcovering error, by its oppoſition to truth, to take the error for truth, and then conclude the truth to be the error: This kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding has ſtrange luck, to gain credit with ſo nice and piercing a judgement as yours.</p>
               <p>What S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Citations, is the very thing the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52610:141"/>
Church beleevs, and practiſes at this day, and what whoever profeſſes, ſhe is ready to imbrace in her ſacred Communion; it being the cuſtom, even at this day, that Saints are not invocated at the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, all the prayers there being purely addreſſed to God.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Petrus Gnaphaeus,</hi> ſince you produce no reaſon why I ſhould not, I cannot ſee but Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Obſervation is ſatisfactory beyond Reply; <hi>Viz.</hi> That ſince his authority, how great ſoever it were, could not preſerve him from being condemned of Hereſie; this fact could not have failed to peep among the reſt of his Hereſies, had the Church not found it conſonant to her faith.</p>
               <p>The laſt is from S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> then which I never ſaw any thing more wretchedly mangled. The place is an explication of <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Rom. ſaying themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools;</hi> This he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the vain power upon the courſe of the Heavens and ſtars, who, by challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging an opinion of wiſdom from the knowledg of ſuch glorious creatures, were loſt in the folly of ſtaying there, and not paſſing on to the Creator. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

But is there nothing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the New Teſtament? I ſhall remember you of one, and that is in the</hi> 17th <hi>of the</hi> Acts, <hi>where</hi> S. Paul <hi>is preaching the Goſpel to the</hi> Athenians: <hi>confutes their (and your) ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of worſhipping the unknown (which was the true) God, by bodily repreſentations in the</hi> 29th <hi>verſe; we ought not to think that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is like unto gold or ſilver graven by art and mens device, God is not like unto any ſimilitude the art of man can deviſe, therefore ought not to be worſhipped by ſimilitudes,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52610:142"/>
therefore no pictures or repreſentations of him are to be made, whether it be of man, or birds, or four-footed beaſts, or of creeping things (as the words are,</hi> Rom. 1.25.) <hi>whereby ſome, inſtead of glorifying God, have diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and changed his glory, as if there were not a greater evil (becauſe of the greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between the infinite Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and any finite thing) to worſhip or repreſent God in a ſhape infinitely below him, then there would be for a subject to go and fall down to a Toad under him, for to worſhip and honour his King in it.

               </p>
               <p n="1">¶ 1. You reply to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> anſwer to the uſual Objection from the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that you cannot ſee that prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a Ceremony; but what's this to the purpoſe? There is no diſtinction in Mr. <hi>White</hi> of Ceremonial, or not Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, but a plain Conſequence autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Apoſtle, that who receives,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52610:143"/>
as of obligation, any part of the Law in vertue of the Law, be it Ceremony, or what elſe it can be, is bound, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of that action, to receive the whole Law. If you derive your Tenet from the Law of Nature, as your men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Ceremonies ſeems to ſuppoſe, what do you cite the Decalogue for? prove the Prohibition contrary to the Law of Nature, and you have done your buſineſs: But ceaſe to object the Jews Law, in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which you either receive it not, and then cannot preſs it, or elſe are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to receive the whole Law with it. This Conſequence too, that if it be not repeated in the new Law, it binds not, you do not ſee: I cannot tell what dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has of a ſudden overcaſt as clear a ſight as I have met with; but me thinks nothing can be plainer, then that if the whole Law be aboliſhed, no part of it can be binding, but in vertue of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in which it is inſerted.</p>
               <p>For the examples you alledge, of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts unrepeated, and yet binding, The firſt is cleerly againſt the Law of nature, and in vertue of that, not the old precept, to be avoided. The ſecond, how do you
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52610:144"/>
prove obliging, farther then the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Laws we live under exact it? But what makes you demand a repetition of the tenth Commandment <hi>in ſo many words?</hi> Cannot the ſame thing be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeveral words? or would you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the command to the words, not what is meant by them? But you have found this command repeated in the New Teſtament in theſe words of S. <hi>Paul We ought not to think the Godhead is like to gold or ſilver, graven by art and mens device;</hi> and if you can make theſe two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>God is not like an Image,</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt not make an Image to adore it,</hi> to be the ſame, I ſhall think that though Images are not, your power in reaſoning is, in ſomthing, very like the Godhead; for 'twill be omnipotent.</p>
               <p>Then you diſcourſe in this manner: <hi>God is not like unto any ſimilitude the art of man can deviſe, therefore ought not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt by ſimilitudes.</hi> If nothing can be like him and conſequently nothing be a ſimilitude, ſure you need not fear that worſhip which can never be, ſince it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a thing which can never be. But I ſuppoſe you mean, by <hi>ſimilitudes,</hi> Images,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52610:144"/>
whether like or unlike; and then pray how does it follow, no Image can be like him, therefore no honor can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to him, that is, no benefit to us, by Images. To worſhip theſe Images, ſo as to beleeve them either him, or like him, which are the things I conceive, the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt, we do abhor with the height of deteſtation; but if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to worſhip him oftner, and more ardently then we ſhould without them, how can it be but that to oppoſe them is to oppoſe his worſhip? <hi>Therefore no Pictures or Repreſentations of him are to be made.</hi> Beſeech you Sir, what Law is there againſt making Pictures which are not like? Sure you would be very ſevere to ill Painters. But the truth is, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures which are made of God are indeed no more then ſigns, which preſent him to our memory, and called pictures of him with no more juſtice, then a Buſh would be called the Picture of Wine. For the nature of a Picture conſiſting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to the eye, the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, colour, and figure of parts, up-a piece of cloth, or wood, which we ſee in the Original, I refer
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52610:145"/>
my ſelf to your own candor to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be guilty of the impiety of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, parts, or colour, or any thing which the art of painting is able to reach, to be in God; for painting is only of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and thoſe groſſe ones too; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wind, or thoſe ſmaller parts which affect the Smell, Taſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is beyond her Sphere. So that none, who is in his ſences, can imagin us ſo damnably ſenceleſſe, as to believe 'tis in its power to frame any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of God, which, with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety can be called a Picture of him. Theſe, which we have, by cuſtom, warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and perhaps begun, by authority of Scripture, bring, by the ſhapes they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Divinity into our memories, and adoration of it, not of the pictures, into our hearts: and, except it be unlawful to remember and adore the Deity, I cannot imagine it ſhould be unlawful to uſe means which conduce to that end.</p>
               <p>By this, I preſume, you already ſee the diſparity of the Compariſon of pictures to a Toad; but firſt, what mean you by <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God in a ſhape?</hi> if you mean, that we hold, either that ſhape to be his, or he to be in it, more then his ubiquity makes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52610:145"/>
him preſent to all things, you either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, or wrong us: and what elſe that expreſſion ſhould ſignifie, I ſee not. Next, what is there of common betwixt theſe Pictures, and the Toad, whether you look upon the end, or means? The end of our Pictures is the Adoration of God, a duty, which, ſince you cannot deny to be often neceſſary, and never unfit, you ſhould deny us no occaſion that prompts us to perform it. And for the means: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, that, as no notion can be attributed to God, but with much impropriety, ſo we cannot chuſe a better than what the Scripture attributes to him in the viſion of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. <hi>antiquus Dierum.</hi> We uſe therefore, to put us in mind of God, a Picture, which preſents to our eyes the reverence of Age, which, if you have any quarrel to, blame the Scripture in which we find it, and which, by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cuſtom, was, without memory of its beginning, and therefore, if <hi>St. Austins</hi> rule hold, like to deſcend from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, preſently conveys to our Soul, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion firſt, and then an adoration of God. For the Toad, what has it, either from nature, or cuſtom, to do with the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52610:146"/>
King, that he that falls down to it, ſhould be thought to honour him? and what can hinder it from being judged, even by the King himſelf, pretended to be honoured by it, a moſt ridiculous and unworthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>What you ſay next, of the conformity of the reaſons brought in the <hi>Acts,</hi> to thoſe in <hi>Iſay,</hi> I ſhall not examine; ſince the concluſion, you make, being no more, then that nothing like to God can be made, I hold it as great impiety to deny it, as I conceive there is impoſſibility of deducing from that truth any thing to the prejudice of this other, which I am maintaining.</p>
               <p>The reſt are Quotations, ſo careleſly gathered, to ſay no more, that I know not whether I ſhould more blame your Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (for I am ſure they owe not their birth to the Candor you profeſſe) in giving your ſelf up to the conduct of others, who are ſo able to guide your ſelf or pitty your misfortune that thoſe you honour with ſo much confidence, ſhould ſo little deſerve it. The words of <hi>Lactantius</hi> are theſe, <hi>Quare non eſt dubium quin Religio nulla eſt, ubicunque Simulacrum eſt.</hi> where
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52610:146"/>
by <hi>Simulacrum,</hi> is plainly meant an Idol, as by the whole intent of the book, which <hi>is contra Gentiles,</hi> by his ſubſequent proof, and by theſe words almoſt immediately preceding, <hi>Non ſub pedibus quarat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, nec a veſtigiis ſuis eruat quod adoret,</hi> evidence paſt diſpute. And had you ſeen the place, you could not have doubted but his <hi>Simulacrum</hi> is a figure believed to be God, and ſo adored, which, till we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lawful, <hi>Lactantius</hi> is very unjuſtly brought to oppoſe us.</p>
               <p>The 36 <hi>Can.</hi> of the Councel of <hi>Elibera</hi> runs thus: <hi>Placuit picturas in Eccleſia eſſe non debere, ne quod colitur aut adoratur, in parietibus depingatur;</hi> A decree which may as well be made now, as then, did Circumſtances require it from the wiſdom of our Governours. For we ſay not, that 'Tis unlawful not to have Pictures in Churches, but, that 'tis not unlawful to have them. Now becauſe the prudence of thoſe Fathers judged them inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in thoſe times of perſecution, and that place (for this Councel of no more then 19 Biſhops concerns only <hi>Spain;</hi>) Can any Candour infer they judged them abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unlawful, and unpermittable to any
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52610:147"/>
Place, Time, or Circumſtance? Beſides, as far as probability may be allow'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Prohibition, it proceeded from the reverence had of Sacred Images, which it therefore forbad, leſt they ſhould run the hazard of being diſgracefully or unhandſomly defaced in thoſe unſetled times, either by the moyſture of the wall, on which they were painted, or the malice of their Perſecutors, impoſſible to be avoyded while they were fix'd to the Fabrick. For what elſe can <hi>Ne in parieti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quod colitur, depingatur,</hi> ſignifie? for ſo it is, and not as you cite it, That nothing be painted which is adored. Which, if true, as 'tis much the likelyeſt to be ſo of any thing hitherto ſuggeſted to my thoughts, It will be very fine, that their care to preſerve Images, ſhould be turn'd into an Argument to overthrow them.</p>
               <p>I cannot find any ſuch words as you mention in <hi>Origen,</hi> nor do believe any elſe will; having read the place you cite with ſome diligence.</p>
               <p>That piece of the Epiſtle of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is looked upon as a foul, and manifeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; The reaſons you may ſee in <hi>Bellarmin de Imag. lib</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. And for the laſt paſſage,

               <p n="1">¶ 1. FRom what has been ſaid, I cannot but conclude that Scripture is ſo far from being a ſufficient Rule to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (meaning, by <hi>Rule,</hi> ſuch a one as we have all this while been talking of) that to rely upon it, with no better an Interpreter of the Letter, then the Letter it ſelf, is the way to deſtroy all means firſt, and then all hopes of Salvation: That principle being the true gate, through which all the Sects, which, with their numerous ſwarms, over-burden and afflict Chriſtianity, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52610:148"/>
Anabaptiſm againſt Presbytery, for Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency againſt all; and how far the Chain may be ſtretched, which already reaches to the 5th. Monarchy, and Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, none knows; But this I am ſure of, that every linck is as ſtrong as the firſt.</p>
               <p>For the reaſon you give, why you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Scripture to be Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have no reaſon to doubt it; 'tis an invincible demonſtration of the force of prejudice, and more of reaſon I ſee nothing in it. Had your mind been in the ſame temper it was in the firſt <hi>Sect.</hi> of this part, would have been reaſon ſufficient, not only to doubt, but to reject it, that you had not evidence of its certainty. For there a man muſt plainly deny aſſent to what even <hi>all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> determine, though he have no-ſo much-as-probable Objection againſt them, upon this onely ground, That he has not evidence their determination is certain, and here he muſt yeeld aſſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has not evidence the thing he aſſents to, is not certain.

               <p>And for your Monuments of Antiquity, I beſeech you pretend not to prove it that way, for I think I deal liberally, if I allow you to have examined ten Authors of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, and what proof are ten of the ſentiments of 1000000? Then what do you find in theſe Authors? certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture cited out of ſuch books, as we ſtill have; but whether thoſe books contained then the ſame number of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52610:149"/>
and Verſes they do now, you will find very few to ſpeak to. Nay I do not beleeve you will find ten in all Ages that give you a Catalogue of the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, much leſs of the Chapters and Verſes: So that your conſpiracy of all Monuments of Antiquity will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to ten men in fifteen Ages. I muſt deſire you not to miſtake what I have ſaid, as if I alſo doubted of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which I acknowledg to be the Word of God, reverence it as ſuch, and know the denyers of it were, for the moſt part, Hereticks. All I aim at, is by an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to ſhew the power of prejudice, to which what is reaſon, when of one ſide, ceaſes to be reaſon when on the contrary. If, therefore, you faithfully purſue your own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, what ever you think, the true ground why you receive Scripture is the preſent Churches Authority, and you ſhould, as you rightly infer, receive the ſenſe, as well as words from her. And for your fear of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> you will need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecurity then your own thoughts, if you reflect that all, which the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Mahumetan Church (if that

Now the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, neceſſary to a concluſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that what was delivered by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was inſpired by God, I am ſure you hold as great impiety to grant, as Blaſphemy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that which we ſubſume; <hi>viz.</hi> that what was delivered by Chriſt did truly proceed from God.

               <p n="3">¶ 3. <hi>Thirdly, I cannot grant your Church was the onely one before</hi> Luthers <hi>time, there's the Greek, Abyſſen, and others there may be in ſeveral parts of the world that I know not of.</hi>

               <p n="3">¶ 3. Thirdly, What you mean here by our Church, I cannot tell; if onely, that number of Orthodox Chriſtians, who live within the Precincts of the Roman, either Dioceſs or Patriarchate, I know no body maintains, I'm ſure I do not beleeve, the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is confin'd to that Pale.

               <p n="4">¶ 4. <hi>Fourthly, I ſee no neceſſity, that any one particular Church ſhould continue uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or that it is neceſſary, the greateſt number of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhould have uncorrupted Religion. In the days of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah <hi>the Prophet, there were but</hi> 700 <hi>that had not bowed the knee to</hi> Baal, <hi>which the Prophet, that thought himſelf alone, knew not of.</hi>

That there is any neceſſity a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church ſhould always remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, or that the greateſt number of profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhould have uncorrupted Religion, are two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, ſince any body does, I am ſure no body is bound to maintain, I am glad they impoſe upon me no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conteſt with you in this Paragraph. But leaſt you ſhould think, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thence that <hi>Tradition</hi> were uncertain; I muſt affirm that, not only a particular Church, but ſcarcely a particular family, that is, well inſtructed, can poſſibly err, if they ſtick to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and that the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52610:152"/>
univerſality of the Church, though ten thouſand times more diſperſed then it is, cannot ſecure it from error, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it.</p>
               <p n="5">¶ 5. <hi>Laſtly, I ſee no proof of your infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, ſure I am, it is a ſafer way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve truths in writing then to be tranſmitted by the various apprehenſions and mmories of multitudes, and truly I beleeve you would not have retained ſo much truth as you have, had it not been for the Bible, and other writings, and ſo I ſee not how you prove any thing has been intirely tranſmitted onely by Tradition. Much leſſe how it is proved, there could creep no error into your Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">¶. 5. Laſtly, I would fain flatter my ſelf, with hopes of ſucceſs, in the deſign I have had to ſerve you; but however that proves, muſt needs take the liberty to think, if you do not yet ſee the proof you mention, the fault is not in the object. Only I preſume there is no miſtake in the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which placed ſingly, may ſpeak an Attribute too much approaching to Divinity to belong to any thing of mortal, but by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary priviledge, ſince it extends it ſelf to all ſubjects whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas with
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52610:152"/>
us 'tis confined to matters of Faith, and ſignifies but this, that we can neither be deceived in what we hear, nor deceive our poſterity in what we relate concerning theſe matters. Now it being the nature of man to ſpeak truth, and the number of men being, in this caſe beyond all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether of hopes, fears, or whatever elſe may be imagined ſhould prevail with them to contradict their nature, I cannot ſee but a little reflexion muſt needs make you acknowledge 'tis beyond the power of imagination it ſelf to put any deceit in their teſtimony, ſince it will be to put an effect, whoſe cauſe, the putter ſees, neither is, nor, can be.</p>
               <p>That Truths may be preſerv'd in writing I doubt not; nay, even better, then by the various apprehenſions, and memories of multitudes: But if there be no variety in their apprehenſions, nor dependance on their memories, continual practice, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing the defects of nature, I cannot ſee but 'tis much eaſier to beat a man from a ſence whereof he has no other hold then a word, appliable to another ſence, then to beat a multitude from the judgements which they are in poſſeſſion of, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52610:153"/>
confirm'd by the daily actions of their whole lives. Beſides, while the writings preſerve the truth, who ſhall preſerve the writings from falſe copying, and all the errors which both negligence and knavery threaten them withall? and if the Veſſel be tainted, what ſhall keep the Wine pure?</p>
               <p>For the reſt, I conceive, that whatever you think of us, your ſelves would not have the truths you have, had not nature maintained that <hi>Tradition</hi> in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, you deny in your words; Your faith of the Bleſſed Trinity is right, becauſe no intereſt has yet moved you to follow your principles againſt it: But give an <hi>Arian</hi> the ſame liberty againſt it, you take againſt us, and if you convince him, you will as much deceive me, as I think you do your ſelves to beleeve you can do it. The ſame I ſay of Baptiſm, of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and the reſt of thoſe truths you profeſs, all which, while you pretend <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is <hi>Tradition</hi> which has truly conveyed to you, and you have kept ſince becauſe no body has oppoſed them, but when they do, have no more hold then of thoſe you have deſerted. Neither
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52610:153"/>
is it poſſible for your principles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an Adverſary that makes advantage of them, neither juſt to condemn him, for it will be to condemn your ſelves and that plea, which, if it juſtifie you, muſt abſolve him.</p>
               <p>That faith has been ſo tranſmitted by <hi>Tradition,</hi> that it has not been written, is not Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> tenet; but that writing, at leaſt the writings we have, is not able ſo to tranſmit it, as is neceſſary for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mankind, without <hi>Tradition.</hi> This being the ſecurity of whatever wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith is contained in; if it be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we know the ſenſe by Tradition: if a Father, he is of authority, in as much as what he writes is conſonant to Tradition; if any thing be found to diſagree, that not having any weight.</p>
               <p n="6">¶ 6. <hi>First, I ask whether an Error cannot overſpread the face of the greateſt Church viſible? It hath done ſo in the</hi> Arians <hi>time, In our Saviours time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, whether an Error once ſpread cannot continue? Arianiſm continued moſt univerſal for many years:</hi> Mahomets <hi>Errors and Blaſphemies for many Ages: Jewiſh Suppoſitious Traditions, longer yet
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52610:154"/>
then they. What ſecurity then can a man have, that Errors could not creep into the the Church? while it is your Principle to embrace any thing your Councils ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">¶ 6. To your firſt Queſtion I anſwer, if that may be called a Church, which wants the only principle which can make a Church, I conceive an error may very eaſily overſpread the face of the greateſt viſible; There being no more to do then to deſert this Rule, and then truth will, not only eaſily, but almoſt certainly deſert her; without adhering to <hi>Tradition,</hi> I know no ſecurity, any number of men, be it never ſo great, can have of truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of natural reaſon, ſuch as are the Maxims of Religion; But let the Church, you ſpeak of, adhere to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and be largely diffuſed, and I conceive it as impoſſible that Error ſhould overſpread it, as that it ſhould be ignorant of what it does every day.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, ſince the ſuppoſal of an Er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s being ſpread, ſuppoſes a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that fence, which only could keep it out, <hi>viz.</hi> cleaving to <hi>Tradition,</hi> I conceive an Error once ſpread not only may, but
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52610:154"/>
will continue without extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Almighty God. Arianiſm, which you exemplifie in, was plainly brought in by preferring the interpretations, which <hi>Arius</hi> made of Scripture, (as you do thoſe of <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c.) before the Doctrine delivered by their Forefathers, neither was there any cure for the diſeaſe, till they purged themſelves of novelty, and reſted in the ancient Doctrine. <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo took the ſame courſe, and all thoſe, whom his impieties will bring to Hell, will owe their damnation to the deſerting of this principle, which had his followers not firſt been cozened from, it had not been poſſible for him to have undon ſo great a part of the world. <hi>Jewiſh Traditions</hi> I have already ſpoken of, and hope I need not again put you in mind, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common with <hi>Tradition</hi> but the name. This principle then, and only this of adhering to <hi>Tradition,</hi> gives a man all imaginable ſecurity that Errors neither have, nor could creep into our Church.</p>
               <p>As for blindly embracing what ever is determined by Councils, I doubt you are not Maſter of our Doctrine in that point. For the Rule, even of Councils themſelves,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52610:155"/>
is <hi>Tradition,</hi> and were it poſſible They ſhould contradict it, we are taught to adhere to <hi>Tradition</hi> againſt both them, and Angels too. Whether the caſe can ever happen I know not, and conceive nothing, but the roving of a wild fancy, will make it poſſible: but if it do, I have told you our Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="7">¶ 7. <hi>What though you have Tenets of a</hi> 1000 <hi>years ſtanding, they are never the truer, ſeeing Errors have been ſo long, and longer ago, and ſome are known to have been propagated as far from Father to Son, it is all one as if they yeſterday begun, ſeeing the ſucceeding age has nothing of Divine truth, which was not in the precedent.

               <p n="7">¶ 7. I agree with you that the age of Errors, gives them no approach to Truth; and that one of 1000 years is no leſſe an Error, then one of but a day old. But you muſt alſo agree with me, that 'tis a great prejudice againſt its being an Error, if a Tenet have with conſtancy and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality been held ſo great a ſpace of time. For what ſubtlety can obſcure it from the eyes of the world, that in ſo long time it ſhould not be diſcovered?

For the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you deſire that every part of our faith was clearly throughout every age,

you may receive it by reflecting that 'tis clearly through the preſent age, which, becauſe of the forementioned principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not be, without its having been ſo through the laſt. Now what your eyes ſhew you in theſe two Ages, your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if ye ſuffer it to ſway you, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſway it) will aſſure you muſt have happened in every age, the caſe being perfectly the ſame in all.</p>
               <p>You think Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Argument a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſme, becauſe a man may take up a new opinion, and think it true, though he be miſtaken. But can he think his new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he takes up, was delivered him by his Forefathers, that is, not new, and not taken up? Till he do this, which is palpable contradiction, let him think his Opinions never ſo true, his thoughts will bring no prejudice to the Argument. For to be True, and to be of Faith, are two quite different things: This, ſuppoſes being delivered, and your opinion is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed newly taken up, that is not delivered, that is not of Faith, and ſeen not to be ſo; now if reaſon, common ſence, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell you that who thinks a thing true, muſt therefore think it of Faith, when, by

This to you, but to a Pagan I acknowledg he is not to be put upon the proof; you may if you pleaſe, for your experience, reflect what yourſelf would ſay to one, and ſee whether you can ſay any thing ſtronger to him, then we do to you; if your thoughts be faithful to you, I doubt, what you deny reaſon againſt your ſelf, muſt either be reaſon againſt him, or you will have much ado to keep your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from being unreaſonable.
